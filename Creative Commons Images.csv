This monoclinal fold extends for slightly over 100 miles in the semi-arid plateau of central Utah. It can be seen via three scenic routes in the park. One route leads to a famous landmark known as the Golden Throne. This landmark is covered in golden sandstone that gives it its name. The Waterpocket Fold lies east of the town of Torrey, three miles west and just southeast of the Middle Desert. This area is prized for its scenic hiking.

I was employed by Ericsson and based in Dun Laoghaire at the Adelphi Centre from 2001 to 2010 and I really liked the town even though the place was going through a period of urban decline and depression.

When I was there we were based in George’s Street which was going down hill at a rapid pace and the company decision to move from the town must have had a huge impact on the town and especially on the restaurants on the main street. 

Before I joined Ericsson I worked for two different companies with offices at Haigh Terrace which became a no-go area at night because of anti-social behaviour related to drug-dealing. Because of the new library complex and the removal of the pond in Moran Park the anti-social problem in the immediate area is no longer an issue even if some locals dislike the library building.

According to a recent report Georges Street is too long as a main street in order to support viable retailing. Therefore, it is proposed that the street be demarcated into distinct quarters: an Interiors Quarter on Lower Georges Street from Cumberland Street to St Michael’s Hospital; the Core Retail Quarter from Bloomfields Shopping Centre to Haigh Terrace; the Commercial &amp; Residential Quarter from Haigh Terrace to Adelphi House; and the Artesian Quarter on Upper Georges Street from Mellifont Avenue to the People’s Park.

Several interventions at street level are required to change the appearance of each quarter and communicate a distinct proposition for each quarter to shoppers and visitors. These interventions will range from the establishment of new town squares; to the creative use of paving, seating, flowerbeds and lighting; to the introduction of new canopies and shading; to the erection of new sculpted features and signage.

It is envisaged that as the development of the retail quarters gain momentum, the demand for retail space will increase. The new mechanisms such as the Property Forum and Retail Forum will be vehicles to focus new retail businesses into clusters for example food and fashion specialty shops in the Artesian Quarter.","https://live.staticflickr.com/341/32710456716_4f6f533c5d_o.jpg","[{""name"":""William Murphy"",""url"":null}]","by-sa","library","jpeg","https://www.flickr.com/","2006-06-23","4368x2912"

Am Kap befinden sich zwei Leuchttürme, ein Peilturm, zwei Militärbunker, die slawische Jaromarsburg und einige touristische Gebäude (Restaurants, Kneipen, Souvenirläden). Aufgrund der geologischen Beschaffenheit und der Wettereinflüsse kommt es vorwiegend im Winter immer wieder zu teilweise großen Abbrüchen am Kap.
Kap Arkona wird oft als der „nördlichste Punkt Rügens“ bezeichnet, was jedoch nicht ganz stimmt. Ungefähr einen Kilometer weiter nordwestlich befindet sich eine Stelle der Steilküste, Gellort genannt, die noch etwas weiter nördlich gelegen ist. Direkt am Fuße des Gellorts liegt der 165 t schwere Findling Siebenschneiderstein, auf Plattdeutsch Söbenschniedersteen. Das Kap bietet einen eindrucksvollen Anblick der Insel, sowohl vom Land als auch vom Wasser aus.

"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Nomads_Simple_Life_(266139764).jpg","The Nomads Simple Life (266139764).jpg","View it LARGE or even LARGER ! ========= From en.wikipedia (2006): ===== Nomad Communities of nomadic people move from place to place, rather than settling down in one location. Many cultures have been traditionally nomadic, but nomadic behaviour is increasingly rare in industrialised countries. There are three kinds of nomads, hunter-gatherers, pastoral nomads, and peripatetic nomads. Nomadic hunter-gatherers have by far the longest-lived subsistence method in human history, following seasonally available wild plants and game. Pastoralists raise herds and move with them so as not to deplete pasture beyond recovery in any one area. Peripatetic nomads are more common in industrialised nations travelling from place to place offering a trade wherever they go. Pastoral Nomads The term ""nomad"" most often refers to one whose subsistence is based upon domestication of animals. This nomadic pastoralism is thought to have developed in three stages that accompanied population growth and an increase in the complexity of social organization. Sadr has proposed the following stages: Pastoralism: This is a mixed economy with a symbiosis within the family. Agropastoralism: This is when symbiosis is between segments or clans within an ethnic group. True Nomadism: This is when symbiosis is at the regional level, mostly it starts between specialized nomadic and agricultural populations. Origin of nomadic pastoralism Nomadic pastoralism seems to have developed as a part of the secondary products revolution proposed by Matt PWNS, in which early pre-pottery neolithic cultures, that had used animals in order to store live meat (on the hoof) began also using animals for their secondary products, for example, milk, wool, hides, manure and traction. The first nomadic pastoral society developed in the period from 6200 - 6000 BC in the area of the southern Levant. There during a period of increasing aridity, PPNB cultures in the Sinai were replaced by a nomadic pastoral pottery using culture, which seems to have been a cultural fusion between a newly arrived mesolithic people from Egypt (the Harifian culture), adopting their nomadic hunting lifestyle to the raising of stock. This quickly developed into what Jaris Yurins has called the circum-Arabian nomadic pastoral techno-complex and is possibly assocoated with the appearance of Semitic languages in the region of the Ancient Near East. The rapid spread of such nomadic pastoralism was typical of such later developments as of the Yamnaya culture of the horse and cattle nomads of the Eurasian steppe, or of the Turko-Mongol spread of the later Middle Ages. Source: Wikipedia Pastoralism Pastoralism is a form of farming, such as agriculture and horticulture. It is animal husbandry: the care, tending and use of animals such as camels, goats, cattle, yaks, llamas and sheep. It also contains a mobile element, moving the herds in search of fresh pasture and water. Pastoralism is found in many variations throughout the world. Composition of herds, management practices, social organization and all other aspects of pastoralism vary between areas and between social groups. Many ?traditional? practices have also had to adapt to changing, modern circumstances. Also the ranches of the USA and the sheep stations and cattle stations of Australia are seen by some as modern variations. Mobility Mobility allows pastoralists to simultaneously exploit more than one environment, thus creating the possibility for arid regions to support human life. Rather than adapting the environment to suit the ?food production system? (Bates, 1998:104) the system is moved to fit the environment. Pastoralists often have an area with a radius of 100-500km. Different mobility patterns can be observed: Nomadic pastoralists: 1) it is a generalized food-producing strategy with its main base relying on the intensive management of herd animals for their primary products of meat and skin, and for their secondary products such as wool or hair, milk, blood, dung, traction, and transport; 2) because of the different climates and environments of the areas where nomadic pastoralism is practiced and because of the ecology of their herd animals, this management includes daily movement and seasonal migration of herds; 3) because a majority of the members of the group are in some way directly involved with herd management, the household moves with these seasonal migrations; and 4) while the products of the herd animals are the most important resources, use of other resources, such as domesticated and wild plants, hunted animals, goods available in a market economy, is not excluded. Transhumance: where members of the group move the herd seasonally from one area to another, often between higher and lower pastures. The rest of the group are able to stay in the same location, resulting in longer-standing housing. Mobility throughout altitudes and the resulting precipitation differences is important. In East Africa, different animals are taken to different regions throughout the year, to match the seasonal patterns of precipitation. The actions of herders are carefully planned, but also constantly adjusted, to match changing conditions. The system is dynamic, to suit the unpredictable landscape (Fagan, 1999). All pastoralist strategies exemplify effective adaptation to the environment. Source: Wikipedia Bakhtiary Tribe The Bakhtiari (or Bakhtiyari) are a group of southwestern Iranian people. A small percentage of Bakhtiari are still nomadic pastoralists, migrating between summer quarters (yayl?q, ?????) and winter quarters (qishl?q, ?????). Bakhtiaris speak Luri . Numerical estimates of their total population widely vary. In Khuzestan, Bakhtiari tribes are primarily concentrated in the eastern part of the province. Bakhtiari people primarily inhabit the provinces of Lorestan, Khuzestan, Chahar Mahaal and Bakhtiari, and Isfahan. In Iranian mythology, the Bakhtiari consider themselves to be descendants of Fereydun, a legendary hero from the Persian national epic, Shahnameh. Many significant Iranian politicians and dignitaries are of Bakhtiari origin. Source: Wikipedia Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province Chahar Mahaal and Bakhtiari is one of the 30 provinces of Iran. It lies in the southwestern part of the country. Its center is the city of Shahrekord. It has an area of 16533 square kilometers and a population of 832,000 (2005 estimate). People and culture The history of the province is tied to that of the Bakhtiari tribe that are descended from the Lur people. The Bakhtiari tribe can be divided into two sub-tribes, Haft Lang and Chahar Lang with various territorial affiliations. The Bakhtiari territories at times also came under Fars province and Khuzestan province. The province has various unique traditions and rituals relative to the 'tribal' lifestyles. Special forms of music, dance, and clothing are noteworthy.

"https://www.flickr.com/photos/figgenhoffer/2598487764/","warned | Juneteenth is the oldest known celebration commemor… | Flickr","Juneteenth is the oldest known celebration commemorating the ending of slavery in the United States.  Dating back to 1865, it was on June 19th that the Union soldiers, led by Major General Gordon Granger, landed at Galveston, Texas with news that the war had ended and that the enslaved were now free. Note that this was two and a half years after President Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation - which had become official January 1, 1863. The Emancipation Proclamation had little impact on the Texans due to the minimal number of Union troops to enforce the new Executive order. However, with the surrender of General Lee in April of 1865, and the arrival of General Granger’s regiment, the forces were finally strong enough to influence and overcome the resistance.

Later attempts to explain this two and a half year delay in the receipt of this important news have yielded several versions that have been handed down through the years. Often told is the story of a messenger who was murdered on his way to Texas with the news of freedom. Another, is that the news was deliberately withheld by the enslavers to maintain the labor force on the plantations. And still another, is that federal troops actually waited for the slave owners to reap the benefits of one last cotton harvest before going to Texas to enforce the Emancipation Proclamation. All or none of them could be true. For whatever the reason, conditions in Texas remained status quo well beyond what was statutory.

General Order Number 3

One of General Granger’s first orders of business was to read to the people of Texas, General Order Number 3 which began most significantly with:

    &quot;The people of Texas are informed that in accordance with a Proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and free laborer.&quot;

The reactions to this profound news ranged from pure shock to immediate jubilation. While many lingered to learn of this new employer to employee relationship, many left before these offers were completely off the lips of their former 'masters' - attesting to the varying conditions on the plantations and the realization of freedom. Even with nowhere to go, many felt that leaving the plantation would be their first grasp of freedom. North was a logical destination and for many it represented true freedom, while the desire to reach family members in neighboring states drove the some into Louisiana, Arkansas and Oklahoma. Settling into these new areas as free men and women brought on new realities and the challenges of establishing a heretofore non-existent status for black people in America. Recounting the memories of that great day in June of 1865 and its festivities would serve as motivation as well as a release from the growing pressures encountered in their new territory. The celebration of June 19th was coined &quot;Juneteenth&quot; and grew with more participation from descendants. The Juneteenth celebration was a time for reassuring each other, for praying and for gathering remaining family members. Juneteenth continued to be highly revered in Texas decades later, with many former slaves and descendants making an annual pilgrimage back to Galveston on this date.

Juneteenth Festivities and Food

A range of activities were provided to entertain the masses, many of which continue in tradition today. Rodeos, fishing, barbecuing and baseball are just a few of the typical Juneteenth activities you may witness today. Juneteenth almost always focused on education and self improvement. Thus often guest speakers are brought in and the elders are called upon to recount the events of the past. Prayer services were also a major part of these celebrations.

Certain foods became popular and subsequently synonymous with Juneteenth celebrations such as strawberry soda-pop. More traditional and just as popular was the barbecuing, through which Juneteenth participants could share in the spirit and aromas that their ancestors - the newly emancipated African Americans, would have experienced during their ceremonies. Hence, the barbecue pit is often established as the center of attention at Juneteenth celebrations.

Food was abundant because everyone prepared a special dish. Meats such as lamb, pork and beef which not available everyday were brought on this special occasion. A true Juneteenth celebrations left visitors well satisfied and with enough conversation to last until the next.

Dress was also an important element in early Juneteenth customs and is often still taken seriously, particularly by the direct descendants who can make the connection to this tradition's roots. During slavery there were laws on the books in many areas that prohibited or limited the dressing of the enslaved. During the initial days of the emancipation celebrations, there are accounts of   former slaves tossing their ragged garments into the creeks and rivers to adorn clothing taken from the plantations belonging to their former 'masters'.

Juneteenth and Society

In the early years, little interest existed outside the African American community in participation in the celebrations. In some cases, there was outwardly exhibited resistance by barring the use of public property for the festivities. Most of the festivities found themselves out in rural areas around rivers and creeks that could provide for additional activities such as fishing, horseback riding and barbecues. Often the church grounds was the site for such activities. Eventually, as African Americans became land owners, land was donated and dedicated for these festivities. One of the earliest documented land purchases in the name of Juneteenth was organized by Rev. Jack Yates. This fund-raising effort yielded $1000 and the purchase of Emancipation Park in Houston, Texas. In Mexia, the local Juneteenth organization purchased Booker T. Washington Park, which had become the Juneteenth celebration site in 1898. There are accounts of Juneteenth activities being interrupted and halted by white landowners demanding that their laborers return to work. However, it seems most allowed their workers the day off and some even made donations of food and money. For decades these annual celebrations flourished, growing continuously with each passing year. In Booker T. Washington Park, as many as 20,000 African Americans once flowed through during the course of a week, making the celebration one of the state’s largest.

Juneteenth Celebrations Decline

Economic and cultural forces provided for a decline in Juneteenth activities and participants beginning in the early 1900’s. Classroom and textbook education in lieu of traditional home and family-taught practices stifled the interest of the youth due to less emphasis and detail on the activities of former slaves. Classroom text books proclaimed Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863 as the date signaling the ending of slavery - and little or nothing on the impact of General Granger’s arrival on June 19th.

The Depression forced many people off the farms and into the cities to find work. In these urban environments, employers were less eager to grant leaves to celebrate this date. Thus, unless June 19th fell on a weekend or holiday, there were very few participants available. July 4th was the already established Independence holiday and a rise in patriotism steered more toward this celebration.

Resurgence

The Civil Rights movement of the 50’s and 60’s yielded both positive and negative results for the Juneteenth celebrations. While it pulled many of the African American youth away and into the struggle for racial equality, many linked these struggles to the historical struggles of their ancestors. This was evidenced by student demonstrators involved in the Atlanta civil rights campaign in the early 1960’s, whom wore Juneteenth freedom buttons. Again in 1968, Juneteenth received another strong resurgence through Poor Peoples March to Washington D.C.. Rev. Ralph Abernathy’s call for people of all races, creeds, economic levels and professions to come to Washington to show support for the poor. Many of these attendees returned home and initiated Juneteenth celebrations in areas previously absent of such activity. In fact, two of the largest Juneteenth celebrations founded after this March are now held in Milwaukee and Minneapolis.

Texas Blazes the Trail

On January 1, 1980, Juneteenth became an official state holiday through the efforts of Al Edwards, an African American state legislator. The successful passage of this bill marked Juneteenth as the first emancipation celebration granted official state recognition. Representative Edwards has since actively sought to spread the observance of Juneteenth all across America.

Juneteenth In Modern Times

Throughout the 80’s and 90’s Juneteenth has continued to enjoy a growing and healthy interest from communities and organizations throughout the country. Institutions such as the Smithsonian, the Henry Ford Museum and others have begun sponsoring Juneteenth-centered activities. In recent years, a number of National Juneteenth Organizations have arisen to take their place along side older organizations - all with the mission to promote and cultivate knowledge and appreciation of African American history and culture.

Juneteenth today, celebrates African American freedom while encouraging self-development and respect for all cultures. As it takes on a more national and even global perspective, the events of 1865 in Texas are not forgotten, for all of the roots tie back to this fertile soil from which a national day of pride is growing. The future of Juneteenth looks bright as the number of cities and states come on board and form local committees and organizations to coordinate the activities. Communication and networking is vital. A sharing of lessons learned throughout all organizations will help expedite this growth while minimizing waste and risks. The JUNETEENTH.com website can play a vital role in these efforts. Thus, it is important to communicate its existence to one and all. Contact your local Juneteenth organizer if you do not see them listed within and let them know about this site. There is no cost for organizations to post their Juneteenth festivities at the website.

Saint-Petersburg. | Marble Palace or Mramorny… | Flickr","<b>Marble Palace or Mramornyi Dvorets <b>was one of the first Neoclassical palaces in Saint Petersburg, Russia. It is situated between the Field of Mars and Palace Quay, slightly to the east from Winter Palace.

The palace was built by Count Grigory Orlov, the favorite of Empress Catherine the Great and the most powerful Russian nobleman of the 1760s. Construction started in 1768 to designs by Antonio Rinaldi, who previously had helped decorate the grand palace at Caserta near Naples. The combination of sumptuous ornamentation with rigorously classicizing monumentality, as practiced by Rinaldi, may be attributed to his earlier work under Luigi Vanvitelli in Italy.

The palace takes its name from its opulent decoration in a wide variety of polychrome marbles. A rough-grained Finnish granite on the ground floor is in subtle contrast to polished pink Karelian marble of the pilasters and white Urals marble of capitals and festoons. Panels of veined bluish gray Urals marble separate the floors, while Tallinn dolomite was employed for ornamental urns. In all, 32 disparate shades of marble were used to decorate the palace.

The plan of the edifice is trapezoidal: each of its four facades, though strictly symmetrical, has a different design. One of the facades conceals a recessed courtyard, where an armored car employed by Lenin during the October Revolution used to be mounted on display between 1937 and 1992. Nowadays, the court is dominated by a sturdy equestrian statue of Alexander III of Russia, the most famous work of sculptor Paolo Troubetzkoy; formerly it graced a square before the Moscow Railway Station.
Fedot Shubin, Mikhail Kozlovsky, Stefano Torelli and other Russian and foreign craftsmen decorated the interior with inlaid coloured marbles, stucco, and statuary until 1785, by which time Count Orlov fell out of favour with the Empress, who had the palace purchased for her own heirs. In 1797–1798 the structure was leased to Stanisław August Poniatowski, the last king of Poland. Thereafter the palace belonged to Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich and his heirs from the Konstantinovichi branch of the Romanov family.

In 1843, Grand Duke Constantine Nikolayevich decided to redecorate the edifice, renaming it Constantine Palace and engaging Alexander Brullov as the architect. An adjacent church and other outbuildings were completely rebuilt, while the interior of the palace was refurbished in keeping with the eclectic tastes of its new owner. Only the main staircase and the Marble Hall survived that refacing and still retain the refined stucco work and elaborate marble pattern of Rinaldi's original decor.

During the Soviet era, the palace successively housed the Ministry of Labour (1917–19), the Academy of Material Culture (1919–36), and the Lenin Museum (1937–91).

Gypsy Jokers Poker Run, Protesting the Right to Associate that has been taken away by the state govt. The laws do not only infringe on the rights of these groups, but should raise concern when a man is given the power to enfore his likes or dislikes. Bikies, right or wrong have a right to associate. There are other laws that deal with consorting, associating with a know criminal, etc. Mr. Rann, the state premier, appear to have personal reasons for his attack on Outlaw Bikies. Maybe he should not hide behind some false front that he can stop drugs and crime, even his own police force has its crime rate. He has brought out some of the most draconian laws. One cannot smoke in their vehicle if there are children in, may seem ok but wait, he also has tried to push legislation to make it illegal to smoke in your own home. This state has seen some of the sickest events in Australia's history, the last involving polies, police, magistrates, educators, known as the Family. They grabbed teen boys from the street and held them captive while perfoming all sorts of sick perverted acts on them while it was all being video taped and then disposed of the bodies. One lad had his rectum split in two by a bottle. Why hasn't Rann taken action against these groups. They are still alive today, and the case was dropped. As the various club leaders said, they are not going to force bikies out, they will always be here. I support the bikies 100%, especially after the treatment I received from the cops for taking photo's as I was coming close to the meeting place in my car.","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Gypsy_Joker_Protest_Run_10.jpg/800px-Gypsy_Joker_Protest_Run_10.jpg?20090811213648","[{""name"":""Dennis Bratland"",""url"":""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Dennis_Bratland""}]","Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic","poker","jpeg","https://commons.wikimedia.org/","2009-08-11","1,024 × 683 "

Ledbetter assigned to the Navy Parachute Team “Leapfrogs”, hits the ground at Citizens Bank Park during the Philadelphia Phillies' pre-game Father's Day show. A video camera attached to Ledbetter's helmet captured the performance as he landed in the infield and received cheering welcome from the Philadelphia fans.

The Calistoga Petrified Forest has been called the best-anywhere petrified forest of Pliocene age.  The fossil wood here is preserved with the most common permineralization mineral - quartz.  The preservation of these trees was the result of burial by a rhyolitic volcanic ash-flow tuff of the Sonoma Volcanics (Upper Pliocene).  The volcanic tuff was erupted from a vent near modern-day Mt. St. Helena (= north of this locality).

This is the only fossil pine tree found so far in the Calistoga Fossil Forest.  All other fossil tree trunks at the site are redwoods.  This pine tree trunk is 43 feet long and 2 feet in diameter.

Classification: Plantae, Pinophyta, Pinopsida Pinales, Pinaceae

Stratigraphy: Sonoma Volcanics, Upper Pliocene, 3.2 to 3.4 Ma

Locality: The Pit Tree, Calistoga Petrified Forest, northern side of Petrified Forest Road, west-southwest of the town Calistoga, eastern Sonoma County, Coast Ranges of northwest-central California, USA

It was founded in 1878 by William Jordan Flake and Erastus Snow, Mormon pioneers and colonizers. According to 2006 Census Bureau estimates, the population of the town is 4,958.

Snowflake is 25 miles south of Interstate 40 (formerly U.S. Route 66) via Highway 77. The Apache Railway‎ provides freight service.

Recently, the town and surrounding area have experienced steady growth, primarily to the east, west and south. An additional 9-holes were added to the 18-hole golf course where the Snowflake Arizona Temple was built by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 2002.

Snowflake experiences a four season climate with a warm (sometimes hot) summer, mild autumn, mild to cold winter and cool, windy spring. Typical high temperatures hover around 90 °F during July and August and 30 to 55 °F in December/January.

This is the &quot;2011 Rogue&quot;, which differs from the &quot;Rogue&quot;.  You can easily tell the difference by looking at the lower compartment--the 2011 model has one diagonal reflective strip; the older model has two thin vertical strips.  This new model features the new Antidote Reservoir, which, among other things, has clips that fold up around the mouth that can be sprung down to prop the bladder to help it dry out.  I've found they're not quite as easy as the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfq4zsd2Udk"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">promotional video</a> shows.  While you're watching videos, check out the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FOtwHUUOis"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">Rogue video</a> which also shows the Aurora--the Rogue's female-fitting sister pack.

Some interesting weights:
Pak only: 9.8 oz
Pak + empty bladder: 15.8 oz
Empty bladder: 5.8oz
Bladder with 16oz of water: 1 lb 5.2 oz
Bladder filled as much as I could, more than 72oz: 4 lbs 8.8 oz
Filled to the brim, this should be just over 5 pounds before I put anything in it.

I've used this for a day now.  I'm very happy with it.  The size is excellent, and the straps do a great job of balancing it.

The only thing I've found that I don't like is removing the bladder from the pack.  I'm not daring enough to remove the hose from the bladder, so I remove the bladder + hose + mouthpiece all at once.  Getting the mouthpiece through the strap isn't that easy because of the right angle the valve is at.

One interesting feature is that the central column of the tower does not reach the ground.  You must climb 10 feet of stairs to reach the start of the column.

River boat &quot;Esmeralda II&quot;. Wooden jet boat with inboard motor. Boat is painted green, white, &amp; red. 125 horsepower Gray Marine engine, propeller, shaft, controls, modified V spoon- bill bow, inverted V stern. 3/8&quot; plywood sides, 2 layer 1/4&quot; plywood laminated bottom, 1/4&quot; plywood bulkheads, oak &amp; spruce frames, canvas splash shield. Paint is flaking. The ’Esmeralda II’ was the first power boat to run through the Grand Canyon. It was built in 1947, by a Seattle Marine architect hired by Ed Hudson, of Paso Robles, CA, with consulting assistance from Dock .
Marston. Hudson’s intent was to use the boat to run the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon, upstream, starting from Lake Mead. The boat was built with a special hull and an inboard propeller protected by a skag, that Hudson hoped would be less likely to be damaged by rocks. It was 19 feet long and 6 feet wide, built of marine plywood over an oak frame. .
.
In 1948, Hudson tried an upriver run in the ’Esmeralda II’, with passengers Dock Marston, Wilson Taylor, and Hudson’s 16 year-old son. The boat was powered by a 4-cylinder, 75 horsepower motor. The upriver attempt was halted at mile 217 when the boat crashed into a tree at the water’s edge. The next attempt came the following year, using the same crew, with the addition of Bestor Robinson. Marston added a canvas shield to protect the engine from the big waves breaking over the bow, and upped the engine horsepower to 125. This time they made a downriver trip first with the intention of studying the river on the way down, as well as caching gas at various spots for use on the upriver portion. They left Lees Ferry on June 12, 1949. Upon reaching Pearce Ferry, they were the first motor run down the Grand Canyon, arriving 5 days later. On the way back they couldn’t make it past the strong currents at Diamond Creek. They tried again in 1950, this time adding another boat and additional crew.

Eruptions occur about twice a day and are 1 to 2 hours in duration.  The geyser consists of a large, subcircular, concentrically-terraced geyserite platform that is 55 to 60 meters in diameter.  The slightly off-center, irregularly-shaped vent is 5.5 to 6.5 meters across.  Runoff channels radiate outward to the west, northwest, north, and northeast.  Much of the eruption runoff ends up percolating downward in the surrounding fields.  Some runoff ends up draining into White Creek and the Tangled Creek valley.

About 70 to 100 minutes before an eruption, overflow commences from the vent.  As the eruption nears, moderately energetic, marginal boiling occurs in the vent.  Eruption initiations are called &quot;meter boils&quot;, involving a decent-sized upward-doming of water.  Tall eruptive bursting can occur immediately or will be delayed by many minutes (this is called a &quot;pause&quot;).

Great Fountain Geyser erupts in &quot;series&quot;, during which there is a succession of small to very tall bursts for about ten minutes.  The first series is typically the tallest and showiest.  Pauses between series are about five minutes long.  Eruption heights are generally lower in successive series.  The first few bursts of any individual series are often the tallest and most energetic.

The wilderness study area is comprised of about 11,000 acres of steep, irregular topography with elevations ranging from 3,600 to 6,800 feet. About half the area is forested. Twenty drainages dissect the area and provide solitude. Seven miles of ridgeline hiking routes offer spectacular panoramic views of the Rocky Mountains. A diversity of important wildlife species live here, including a thriving population of mountain goats that occupies the high outcroppings. Other common species include elk, black bear, bighorn sheep, mule deer, osprey, and golden eagles. About 40 primitive campsites are available along the Holter Lake shoreline. A portion of the Sleeping Giant area is also part of the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail. Several deteriorating structures near the river evoke the lifestyles of early settlers.

Popular recreation activities include  Hiking, sightseeing, wildlife viewing, primitive camping, fishing.

LEED is a third party certification program and the nationally accepted benchmark for the design, construction and operation of high performance green buildings and Platinum is the highest rating obtainable.  This facility would be the 12th LEED certified building in the National Park Service and only the 6th LEED Platinum certified building in the National Park Service. NPS photo by Dana Belcher.

Estimates indicate that about 70,000 people came to enjoy Fair Day. The 2012 Fair Day featured a range of activities. The main music stage offered up Maxine Kauter, Brendan Maclean, Mary Kiani, Gen Chadwick, Shimtastic, Kristy Apps, Candy Royalle, Sloppy Joe, Miss Gaynor Tension and Blackcat Lounge - Queer Cabaret. There was also the traditional Mr and Mrs Fair Day comp which was hosted by Charisma Belle, with judges Anthony Defina (Chelsea Bun), Glenn Hansen and Fiona Gamble. Other entertainment on the day included Pot of Love, an interactive stall by artist Amanda King, Rainbow Reuse and performances from Mardi Gras Youth Festival participants. Pet's of the four legged kind even showed up to join in the fun. Dogs and their owners competed in Owner/Dog Look-A-Like, Best ‘Pick Up’ Dog, Best Dressed Dog and The Famous Doggywood Obstacle Course. The Gaydar Lounge, incorporating Gaydar Radio was popular with those wanting to chill, as was The Finlandia Lounge.

Quite a strange bug. From Evolutionary Biology Lab: &quot;Neriidae is a relatively small family of true flies (Diptera) with long, stilt-like legs. Most species are found in the tropics. Neriids have very interesting behaviours, and many species are strikingly sexually dimorphic, with males having much longer legs, heads and/or antennae than females. Like piophilid flies, neriid larvae have the ability to leap during the stage just before pupation when they migrate from the larval feeding substrate to the pupation site.

Today Sydney once again enjoyed one of the premiere Music Festivals to hit Australia - the Future Music Festival.

Randwick, in Sydney's eastern suburbs was blasted by festival goers, and for the most part, the crowd was not disappointed.

The fest which attracted 50,000 fans, had a line-up that ranged from Psy to alt-indie rockers The Stone Roses.

Industry talk as some folks questioned the use of the phrase &quot;future music&quot; for bands who had found fame and success decades ago, including The Stone Roses and The Prodigy, despite both acts being strong drawcards for many fans at the event.

There were plenty of other hot acts on the marquee included Rita Ora, Australian band The Temper Trap and Avicii.

Well done to everyone involved in the success of this years Future Music Festival.

AVICII
ANNOUNCED AS THE EDM HEADLINER AT THIS YEAR'S FUTURE MUSIC FESTIVAL!!

Future Entertainment can now officially confirm that chart-topping Swedish superstar and worldwide phenomenon Avicii has been added to the already monumental line-up for this year's Future Music Festival in March!

Set to bring his massive production to the headlining spot of the EDM stage at this year's Future Music Festival, 2x Grammy award nominee Avicii has certainly proved himself as the EDM force to be reckoned with since he exploded on to the scene in 2011. Put quite simply, in the relatively short time since we first heard his name, Avicii has accomplished more than most artists would dream of in an entire lifetime. And, at just 23 years of age, Avicii is just getting started!

Best known for his exquisite production skills, his prolific live performances and a string of international mega-hits including the worldwide phenomenon, 'Levels', (which conquered music charts worldwide racking up over 50 million YouTube views, and was declared David Guetta's &quot;Tune of 2011&quot;) Avicii is without a doubt one of the most in demand artists on the planet.
2012 saw the Swede skyrocket. Kicking the year off with the 'House for Hunger' tour, Avicii and manager Ash Pournouri donated a staggering $1million to the organization 'Feeding America', by doing a not-for-profit 27-stop tour of the U.S.

The year also saw him headline some of the world's biggest music festivals including Coachella, Ultra Music (where he was joined on-stage by pop queen Madonna), Lollapalooza, Electric Daisy Carnival, Tomorrowland, Exit Festival, Creamfields, Mysteryland, Austin City Limits. He was also recently ranked as the second-most influential under-30 person in music by Forbes magazine.

Most recently, Avicii has launched the Avicii x You project which will see him collaborate with fans, producers and musicians from all over the world for his next single. All profits from the single will again go to the 'Feeding America' charity.

2013 will see this prodigal wiz-kid join the hallowed ranks of the Future Music Festival. The Day Of The Dead-Set Awesome is most certainly upon us and it's set to be all the more awesome with Avicii onboard!

The unstoppable force that is Avicii will headline the EDM stage at this year's Future Music Festivals alongside fellow heavyweights Dizee Rascal, Hardwell, Steve Aoki, Madeon + many more.

The Future Music Festival 2013 pinata has officially popped!

It's the 'Day Of The Dead-Set Awesome' and this year Future Music Festival is set to rock your skulls off! We've been brewing something special, and full of more mind-blowing music than you can poke a cactus at... Future Music Festival 2013 is going to kick harder than a Tijuana donkey on peyote! Where else would you want to be? Our Casa is your casa muchacho!

With the most innovative and dynamic line-up to date, Future Entertainment is bringing you a curated arena and two super-sized main stages jam-packed with the hottest talent the world has on offer.

The Prodigy will give you the Warriors Dance Arena - an entire arena dedicated to hard-edged, and heavy bass driven music plus some of the world's most cutting-edge dub-step acts. The stage is set to showcase why this band deserves every sense of credibility and admiration attached to their name. It's going to be huge! Epic if you will. Joining them in the Warriors Dance Arena will be Boys Noize (Terminator-esque skull show! New album out this Friday), Feed Me Live (Live Teeth Show), FMF 2012 heroes Kill The Noize, Zeds Dead and Borgore. Another very welcome addition to the Warriors Dance Arena is international tastemaker and legendary DJ in his own right, Zane Lowe. This man has quite literally had a hand in the shaping careers of more than one of the artists on this line-up and has truly earned his stripes amongst the best. With each act as illustrious and defining as the next, be prepared... the Warriors are coming.

Fresh from breaking records for the fastest selling rock tour in UK history (220,000 tickets in 68 minutes!) the pioneers of alternative rock The Stone Roses are bringing their Manchester-borne reunion tour to Aussie shores. Joining them on the live front are fellow Brits Bloc Party. Returning to Australia for the first time since the release of their critically acclaimed new album Four they'll be sending fans into an absolute frenzy as they make their debut Future Music Festival appearance.

In a move unlike any other, International sensation and K-Pop superstar PSY has also been added to the bill. The recent online obsession over his Gangnam Style video has turned the South Korean into a global phenomenon. His single has had in excess of 400 million youtube views and has reached the number 1 spot in 33 countries and counting! Arriving in Australia this Sunday, Psy will perform on X-Factor and share with a captive nation his EX-PSY-TMENT about debuting his live show at Future Music Festival 2013.

Off the back of a triumphant performance at the AFL Grand Final that saw their smash hit album Conditions soar back into a Top 10 position in the ARIA charts, our boys The Temper Trap will be showing the internationals how we hold our own. Adding a little more Oz to the concoction will be indie-rock wunderkinds Gypsy &amp; The Cat - returning with a much anticipated new album mixed by superstar Dave Fridman (The Flaming Lips, MGMT) and a new single 'Bloom' which shot straight to number 5 on the world wide hype machine.

Expect things to get a little bonkers with UK powerhouse MC and festival must-have Dizziee Rascal back on the bill. Fellow countrymen DJ Fresh and Rudimental have also had extremely impressive years. With a string of hits and sold out shows to each of their names respectively, these live acts know how to get the party started. Period. Also along for the ride we give you the chart-topping New York pop-rockers Fun. And you better believe it will be!

This season, Future Music Festival has pulled together an array of the finest female talent on the planet. First up, hailing from Harlem, we have the hard-hitting, natural born lyricist Azealia Banks. With a much anticipated new album on the way, this provocative lady of the moment is all set to deliver a hot and heavy set featuring tracks from her hit EP '1991'. Next up, Rita 'This Is How We Do' Ora will be taking to the stage. With no less than 3 number 1 UK hits under her Alexander Wang belt and a slew of burgeoning international praise, 2013 is all about Rita's Ora! On the topic of UK sensations, Ellie Goulding will be making her much-awaited Australian festival debut. Rounding off an almost perfect female contingent are the ever-impressive Aussies (and Future Music favourites), Nervo.

If ever there was an EDM all-star line-up, to end all other line-ups, this would undoubtedly be it. FMF 2013 brings you electronic icons Steve Aoki, A-Trak (Live), Madeon and Hardwell. The EDM A-Team has officially landed.

The undisputed heavyweight champion of underground and heralded king of Ibiza, Sven V th will be bringing his Cocoon Heroes concept down under for the first time. Returning for his 5th performance on FMF, V th will head up the strongest techno line-up in Future Music history. We kid you not. Cocoon Heroes will showcase fellow techno-titans Richie Hawtin, Ricardo Villalobos, Seth Troxler and Magda. Featuring full lights and production, Cocoon Heroes will boast all of the elements that make this the best event on the white island each summer, and much, MUCH more!

Trance-a-holics can look forward to riding every bone-tingling breakdown and build-up as we announce Wake Your Mind! Curated by none other than trance visionaries Cosmic Gate the Wake Your Mind stage will feature vocalist Emma Hewitt, W&amp;W, tyDi, Super 8 &amp; Tab and Ben Gold.

Last, but by no means least Australia's very own The Stafford Brothers, Timmy Trumpet, Tenzin and Bombs Away will once again join the hallowed ranks. Hold on to your margaritas - these Aussies are LOCO!! Party time? Excellente.

What is now a rite of passage for all music lovers, Future Music Festival is back! The Day Of The Dead-Set Awesome is upon us. This is the festivale de m sica futuro...Taco Taco muchachos!

Ray, born in San Francisco, California, moved to Vancouver, Canada where the Signorello family continues to maintain a home. Ray divides his time between Napa, San Francisco, Vancouver and business related travel. Ray's father, Ray Sr., initiated the vineyard project during the mid 1970's by purchasing the 100-acre estate located on the Silverado Trail in the beautiful Napa Valley. Ray Sr. worked side by side with Ray Jr., establishing the winery's reputation for excellence until his passing in the fall of 1998. No Turning Back Signorellos' original plan was to grow quality grapes to sell to existing wineries, but the harvest of 1985 changed this plan into a new level of evolvement. The bountiful crop allowed Signorellos to custom crush the excess grapes. This opportunity demonstrated what fabulous wine their vineyards were capable of producing. The project continues to grow, as do the spectacular 42 acres planted in several different varietals. Ray's continuing effort represents the invested energies that created this reality from a dream. In 1986 the Signorellos began the second phase of the venture, this was the building of the main winery structure. This beautiful building is used for barrel storage, wine tasting and retail sales. Along with the building of the winery, wine production was expanded to include Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot Noir. By the end of the 1980's the Signorello family was thoroughly committed to making wine as well as growing grapes. The decade of the nineties proved to be pivotal for Signorello Estate. In 1990 the first planting of red varietals began on the property- Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Syrah. What brought the Signorellos to the Napa Valley was the romantic side of winemaking; growing grapes, working the land, and enjoying the wine country lifestyle of camaraderie, good wine and great meals. While the Valley lifestyle is a very real part of the business, there is a serious responsibility to making a dream become a reality, both father and son realized this fact early in the endeavor. This venture was a dream; now it is reality.","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Signorello_Estate_Winery%2C_Napa_Valley%2C_California%2C_USA_%288349623355%29.jpg/450px-Signorello_Estate_Winery%2C_Napa_Valley%2C_California%2C_USA_%288349623355%29.jpg?20130331151615","[{""name"":""File Upload Bot (Magnus Manske)"",""url"":""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:File_Upload_Bot_(Magnus_Manske)""}]","Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic","wine tasting","jpeg","https://commons.wikimedia.org/","2013-03-31","3,456 × 4,608 "

It is widespread in the tropical Atlantic, breeding colonially in trees in Florida, the Caribbean and Cape Verde Islands. It also breeds along the Pacific coast of the Americas from Mexico to Ecuador including the Galápagos Islands. It has occurred as a vagrant as far from its normal range as the Isle of Man, Denmark, Spain, England, and British Columbia. The Magnificent Frigatebird is 100 cm (39 inches) long with a 215 cm (85 inch) wingspan. Males are all-black with a scarlet throat pouch that is inflated like a balloon in the breeding season. Although the feathers are black, the scapular feathers produce a purple iridescence when they reflect sunlight (in contrast the male Great Frigatebird has a green sheen). Females are black, but have a white breast and lower neck sides, a brown band on the wings, and a blue eye-ring that is diagnostic of the female of the species. Immature birds have a white head and underparts. This species is very similar to the other frigatebirds and is similarly sized to all but the Lesser Frigatebird. However, it lacks a white axillary spur, and juveniles show a distinctive diamond-shaped belly patch. The Magnificent Frigatebird is silent in flight, but makes various rattling sounds at its nest. This species feeds mainly on fish, and also attacks other seabirds to force them to disgorge their meals. Frigatebirds never land on water, and always take their food items in flight. It spends days and nights on the wing, with an average ground speed of 10 km/h, covering 223±208 km before landing. They alternately climb in thermals, to altitudes occasionally as high as 2500 m, and descend to near the sea surface.","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/The_Magnificent_Frigatebird_%28Fregata_magnificens%29_North_Seymour_Island_Galapagos.JPG/800px-The_Magnificent_Frigatebird_%28Fregata_magnificens%29_North_Seymour_Island_Galapagos.JPG?20130420223420","[{""name"":""Alvarosevilladesign"",""url"":""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Alvarosevilladesign""}]","Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported","Caribbean islands","jpeg","https://commons.wikimedia.org/","2013-04-20","1,280 × 720 "

There, it joins the West Fork of the Bruneau, then the East and West Forks join to form the mainstem. 40 miles of the Bruneau River are designated wild, and a 0.6-mile stretch at the Indian Hot Springs access point is designated recreational. The combination of sparkling water, steep multi-colored cliffs and an interesting association of plants and animals make this desert canyon one of superior natural beauty and recreational appeal. The Bruneau River also provides challenging whitewater as it flows through a deep, wild and remote desert canyon.

The Bruneau and Jarbidge Rivers have a national reputation among paddlers for their outstandingly remarkable float boating and associated experiences along the designated river sections, notably multi-day river trip options that feature remote, challenging whitewater (Class III, IV and V). Only very experienced boaters should float the 69 miles of the Bruneau and Jarbidge rivers due to challenging rapids, log jams and other hazards.

Landscape forms on the Bruneau and throughout the Owyhee Canyonlands vary from broad, open sagebrush steppes to narrow canyons, some exceeding 800 feet in depth.The canyons are dominated by a mixture of high, vertical lines and forms of coarse-textured, red, brown, or blackish eroded cliffs, often glazed with yellow to light green micro-flora. Steep diagonal lines frame triangular forms associated with talus slopes which feature yellow and subdued green sagebrush-bunchgrasses, dark green juniper, medium-textured, reddish rhyolite rubble fields and coarse-textured, blackish basalt rubble fields. Large boulders and whitewater rapids are interspersed between the calm reaches.

"https://www.flickr.com/photos/kenlund/9179386345/","Looking North from Willis Tower Skydeck, Chicago, Illinois… | Flickr","The Chicago River is a system of rivers and canals with a combined length of 156 miles (251 km) that runs through the city of Chicago, including its center (the Chicago Loop). Though not especially long, the river is notable for being a reason why Chicago became an important location, with the related Chicago Portage being a link between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi Valley waterways and eventually the Gulf of Mexico.
 
The River is also noteworthy for its natural and man-made history. In 1887, the Illinois General Assembly, partly in response to concerns arising out of an extreme weather event in 1885 that threatened the city's water supply, decided to reverse the flow of the Chicago River through civil engineering by taking water from Lake Michigan and discharging it into the Mississippi River watershed. In 1889, the Illinois General Assembly created the Chicago Sanitary District (now The Metropolitan Water Reclamation District) to replace the Illinois-Michigan Canal, which had become inadequate to carry the city's increasing sewage and commercial navigation needs, with the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, a much larger waterway. The District completed this man-made hydrologic connection between the Great Lakes and Mississippi watershed in 1900 by reversing the flow of the Main Stem and South Branch of the river using a series of canal locks, and increasing the river's flow from Lake Michigan, causing it to empty into the new Canal. In 1999, this system was named a 'Civil Engineering Monument of the Millennium' by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). The river is also noted for the local custom of dyeing it green on St. Patrick's Day.
 
The river is memorialized, in part, by two horizontal blue stripes on the Municipal Flag of Chicago. The river also serves as inspiration for one of Chicago's ubiquitous symbols: a three-branched, Y-shaped symbol (called the municipal device) is found on many buildings and other structures throughout Chicago; it represents the three branches of the Chicago River.

Ducks top Hoyas in Armed Forces Classic at Camp Humphreys

By Tim Hipps
U.S. Army Installation Management Command

CAMP HUMPHREYS, South Korea – In a season opener between teams led by newcomers, Joseph Young scored 24 points to lead No. 19 Oregon to an 82-75 victory over Georgetown in the 2013 Armed Forces Classic here.

The Ducks and Hoyas tipped off Nov. 9 at 10:16 a.m., on a Saturday morning in the Humphreys Community Fitness Center. For college basketball fans across America, the game was one of many season openers on Friday night. Only one, however, was played before 2,100 U.S. troops and their family members, along with a worldwide television audience on ESPN.

“We’re about to start the journey to determine who is the best team in college basketball, the best team in the country, and we’re doing it in front of the best team in the world,” ESPN announcer Jay Bilas said. “I’m in absolute awe of the commitment, the sacrifice, of our men and women in uniform.”

Young, a junior guard who transferred from Houston is a son of Michael Young, who played for the high-flying “Phi Slama Jama” teams of the early 1980’s. He grabbed five rebounds and was perfect on 12 free throws in his first game as a Duck.

Joshua Smith, a 6-foot-10, 350-pound junior center who transferred from UCLA, led Georgetown (0-1) with 25 points on 10-of-13 shooting and 5 of 9 free throws before fouling out of his first game as a Hoya with 9 seconds remaining.

Jason Calliste made all 11 of his free throws and scored 16 points for Oregon (1-0). Mike Moser added 15 points, seven rebounds and a career-high six steals, the most by an Oregon player in 15 seasons. Darius Wright was the last Duck to post six steals in a game against USC on Jan. 7, 1999.

“We came a long way, so we really didn’t want to lose this one,” Moser said. “It definitely feels good to go home – a 12-hour ride – with a win.”

Damyean Dotson grabbed eight rebounds and Johnathan Loyd had seven assists for Oregon. Loyd recorded his 304th career assist for a spot on the Ducks’ top 10 list. 

The Hoyas shot 1 of 15 from 3-point range, failed to find much offensive continuity, and were outrebounded, 40-32.

“Things we can control, we have to control,” Georgetown coach John Thompson III said. “We had too many untimely unforced turnovers. We got our rhythm offensively, but we gave up a lot of threes in a row – it felt like four or five. The timing of that is what we have to learn. When we had to get a stop or a rebound, we didn’t.” 

Oregon took an 18-7 lead via a 12-2 run, capped by two free throws by Calliste with 12:27 remaining in the first half. Calliste also converted a three-point play that gave the Ducks a 30-23 lead with 5:25 remaining in the period. Oregon led, 37-34, at halftime.

Georgetown took its first lead since 2-0 on a steal by Markel Starks and Smith’s feed to Jabril Trawick for a layup and a 40-39 lead with 18:06 left. D’Vauntes Smith-Rivera’s jumper put Georgetown ahead, 42-39. Loyd responded with a 3-pointer, Young followed with a layup, and the Ducks led the rest of the way.

Starks finished with 16 points and four assists for Georgetown. Trawick added 11 points and three rebounds. Before departing, Moser saluted the troops who welcomed the Ducks to Camp Humphreys, their most distant regular-season game site in school history.

“We had a lot of fun,” Moser said. “Getting a chance to hang out with the troops for a couple days inspired us to try and come out here and win this game.”

Played on Veterans Day weekend, the game featured a military theme throughout. Rather than players’ last names, Army values, such as “Courage,” “Integrity” and “Respect,” adorned the back of Georgetown’s camouflage-patterned jerseys. The backs of the Ducks’ camouflage-patterned jerseys displayed: “USA.” Members of both coaching staffs wore military-style cargo pants and combat boots. 

“This was an unbelievable experience,” Thompson said. “It was a privilege to play in this environment, and it was a privilege to play in front of the Soldiers. One of the most rewarding times was serving lunch yesterday and getting the chance to interact with the young men and women stationed here at Camp Humphreys.”

Georgetown players Nate Lubick and Starks also were appreciative.

“This was a great opportunity to get a close-up look at what life is like for the men and women who protect our country,” Lubick said. “We’re very fortunate to have the opportunity to come here and play a game to thank them for all they do.”

“We’re blessed to have the chance to come here and see and tour the base and the helicopters,” Starks added. “It’s amazing all that they do and we’re really thankful to get the chance to meet everyone here.” 

Folks at Camp Humphreys thought likewise.

“It’s such a blessing,” said Cassie Gaudette, wife of Army Capt. Brian Gaudette. “I don’t think that they can truly understand how exciting and wonderful it is to have a little piece of home and have the teams come here to South Korea. We’re originally from Eugene [home of the Oregon Ducks], so this was really exciting to see.”

Oregon played without sophomores Dominic Artis and Ben Carter, who were suspended nine games for violating NCAA rules by selling school-issued athletic apparel. If only they knew what they missed.

On my walk around the city to see what is happening, June 27, 2014 Christchurch New Zealand.  

 A shadow-catcher is bringing New Regent St's boarded-up shop frontages to life.

By night, St Albans artist Jeremy Sauzier captures the outline of people's shadows with a tripod, a light and a chalk pen.

By day, he fills them in with shades of blue.

Sauzier, 38, expects his &quot;transitional&quot; project Frieze: Stand in the Sun to continue through to the end of July.

&quot;It's sort of a play on words between literally standing still and a frieze,&quot; he said.

&quot;It will take me a wee while. I want to get it looking really finished and give it all two coats.&quot;

The five boarded-up units he is using as a canvas are owned by the same Christchurch family.

Sauzier started &quot;collecting&quot; and painting shadows at art school in 2005.

&quot;Everyone has got a shadow. I like that,&quot; he said.

In New Regent St, he has painted shadows of friends, shop owners, tourists and strangers who were drawn into the project while walking past.

Sauzier also features in the artwork; a friend collected his shadow while he was playing with his daughter.

&quot;[Indigo] just started climbing up on me. We were laughing and my friend just went for it,&quot; he said.

There's a cafe scene by Coffee Lovers, featuring French tourists, a father and son, and a Christchurch film-maker.

&quot;The tram drivers are not in there yet.&quot;

The boarded-up frontages have previously prompted complaints from New Regent St retailers who considered them unsightly.

The fate of the buildings is still unclear, but Sauzier's artwork will brighten them up in the meantime.

He was grateful for the New Regent St site because he unsuccessfully approached several different building owners around the central city before securing it.

&quot;The big thing for me is to have a safe place to do it.

&quot;I'm really enjoying working down here.&quot;

NPS photo by Michael Quinn.

On June 30, 1956, a Trans World Airlines (TWA) Super Constellation L-1049 and a United Airlines DC-7 collided in uncongested airspace 21,000 feet over the Grand Canyon in Arizona, killing all 128 people onboard the two flights. The tragedy spurred an unprecedented effort to modernize and increase safety in America’s postwar airways, culminating in the establishment of the modern Federal Aviation Administration.

Grand Canyon National Park commemorated the 58th anniversary of the midair collision at 10 a.m. on June 30th by holding simultaneous wreath laying ceremonies at the United Airlines Memorial in Grand Canyon Pioneer Cemetery, and at the TWA Memorial in the Flagstaff Citizens Cemetery. Visitors to the park were able to participate in a series of interpretive programs about the collision at Desert View throughout the day on the 30th and were invited to attend a special evening program by archaeologist Ian Hough at McKee Amphitheater at 8:30 p.m.

On Tuesday, July 8, 2014, the National Park Service (NPS) dedicated one of the nation’s newest National Historic Landmarks, the 1956 Grand Canyon TWA-United Airlines Aviation Accident Site in Grand Canyon National Park. This site commemorates a horrific airline collision over the Grand Canyon in 1956.

The public dedication ceremony of the National Historic Landmark designation took place at the Desert View Amphitheater looking out toward the crash site. This ceremony remembered those who perished in the crash, recognized the significance of the accident, and acknowledged family members and friends of the crash victims.","https://live.staticflickr.com/3875/14930530542_960b0bb01c_o.jpg","[{""name"":""Grand Canyon National Park"",""url"":null}]","by","Grand Canyon","jpeg","https://www.flickr.com/","2014-06-30","4654x3138"

The Daffodil Woodland extends over two hectares on the south-west side of the Avon River in Hagley Park. This woodland was once inhabited by a menagerie which included silk worms, deer, ferrets, kangaroos, angora and cashmere goats, opossums, monkeys, wallabies, llamas, a lemur, a tortoise, a Californian bear and an emu called Jack. This occurred between 1864 and 1930 when the Canterbury Horticultural and Acclimatisation Society leased 1.5 hectares of ground from the Domains Board. During this lease the public was able to view unusual birds, animals and fish bred for liberation throughout Canterbury or imported for public enjoyment. To many people, this popular area became known as The Zoo. In 1933, Park Curator James McPherson, initiated the planting of daffodils among the established woodland and of oak and ash trees. In the first year, 16,000 bulbs were publically donated and planted. By 1943, 500,000 bulbs had been planted and these provide the basis of what is today one of the most popular springtime attractions in New Zealand.

"https://www.flickr.com/photos/peterm7/17568524784/","Mullingar Road League Rnd 4 2015 | This is a photograph from… | Flickr","This is a photograph from the 4th and final round of the 2015 Mullingar Road League which was held in Belvedere House and Gardens, Mullingar, Co. Westmeath, Ireland on Wednesday 27th May 2015 at 20:00. The weather was perfect for running and racing again and gave bright sunshine with some breeze. The weather conditions were favourable for runners this evening. As this was the final night of a very successful league there were many category prizes up for grabs with runners having to ensure they ran their races to gain the required finish times for the overall calculations. There was a great atmosphere at the finish as spectators cheered on the runners. This year's 5KM is ran on a modified route based on the route from the last couple of years. The final 1KM is within the Belvedere Gardens bringing runners down to the lakeside for a second time and finishing along the aptly named Stream Of Life. The route modification means that the race offers a slightly faster route than the hill finish of previous years. In the prize giving and awards in Belvedere House Cafe there were refreshments served for runners and this brought the curtain down on the Road League for 2015. 
 The race is promoted by Mullingar Harriers for the Pat Finnerty Memorial Cup. Competitors need to run 3 races out of the 4 races in May (any order) to be considered in the overall placing in categories at the conclusion of the league. Runners can also choose to just run one race without being considered for the overall league placings. Over 330 people took part in tonight's event bring the total from the four nights to so far to well over 1,400 runners. As with all of the previous weeks the new finish area provided a nice space for runners to stay around and chat in the evening sunshine. The Mullingar Road League 2015 is now over but has continued successfully and looks to add to the success in the history of this great series.  Despite the bright evenings the photographic conditions in Belevedere are difficult so this photograph is part of a smaller than usual photograph set as there were many blurred photographs this evening. 
The &quot;Road League&quot; is something of a misnomer but is an indication of the League's origins on the roads around Ladestown Mullingar prior to it's move into Belvedere in 2008. The Road League is the envy of many other races in the country as the Belvedere locations offers a completely traffic free 5KM route.

Please email <b>petermooney78 AT gmail DOT com</b> with the links to the photographs you would like to obtain a full resolution copy of. We also ask race organisers, media, etc to ask for permission before use of our images for flyers, posters, etc. We reserve the right to refuse a request. 

<i><b>In summary please remember when requesting photographs from us</b></i> - <b>If you are using the photographs online</b> all we ask is for you to provide a link back to our Flickr set or Flickr pages. You will find the link above clearly outlined in the description text which accompanies this photograph. Taking these photographs and preparing them for online posting takes a significant effort and time. We are not posting photographs to Flickr for commercial reasons.

<b>Let's get a bit technical: We use Creative Commons Licensing for these photographs</b>
We use the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License for all our photographs here in this photograph set. What does this mean in reality?
The explaination is very simple. 
<b>Attribution</b>- anyone using our photographs gives us an appropriate credit for it. This ensures that people aren't taking our photographs and passing them off as their own. This usually just mean putting a link to our photographs somewhere on your website, blog, or Facebook where other people can see it. 
<b>ShareAlike</b> – anyone can use these photographs, and make changes if they like, or incorporate them into a bigger project, but they must make those changes available back to the community under the same terms. 

Above all what Creative Commons aims to do is to encourage creative sharing. See some examples of Creative Commons photographs on Flickr: <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/"">www.flickr.com/creativecommons/</a>

<b>I ran in the race - but my photograph doesn't appear here in your Flickr set! What gives?</b>

As mentioned above we take these photographs as a hobby and as a voluntary contribution to the running community in Ireland. Very often we have actually ran in the same race and then switched to photographer mode after we finished the race. Consequently, we feel that we have no obligations to capture a photograph of every participant in the race. However, we do try our very best to capture as many participants as possible. But this is sometimes not possible for a variety of reasons:

     ►You were hidden behind another participant as you passed our camera
     ►Weather or lighting conditions meant that we had some photographs with blurry content which we did not upload to our Flickr set
     ►There were too many people - some races attract thousands of participants and as amateur photographs we cannot hope to capture photographs of everyone
     ►We simply missed you - sorry about that - we did our best!


You can email us <b>petermooney78 AT gmail DOT com</b> to enquire if we have a photograph of you which didn't make the final Flickr selection for the race. But we cannot promise that there will be photograph there. As alternatives we advise you to contact the race organisers to enquire if there were (1) other photographs taking photographs at the race event or if (2) there were professional commercial sports photographers taking photographs which might have some photographs of you available for purchase. You might find some links for further information above.  

<b>Don't like your photograph here?</b>
That's OK! We understand! 

If, for any reason, you are not happy or comfortable with your picture appearing here in this photoset on Flickr then please email us at <b>petermooney78 AT gmail DOT com</b> and we will remove it as soon as possible. We give careful consideration to each photograph before uploading. 

<b>I want to tell people about these great photographs!</b>
Great! Thank you! The best link to spread the word around is probably <b>http://www.flickr.com/peterm7/sets</b>

Westmeath, Ireland on Wednesday 12th August 2015 at 20:00. The race is hosted by North Westmeath Athletic Club. The race was blessed with the most beautiful summer's evening making for perfect weather conditions for racing. The race has grown in stature and popularity over the years and is now one of the most well attended road races in the midlands. The race offers prizes in all categories. Castlepollard 5KM Road Race attempts to support young runners and walkers by organising a range of underage races around the town square before the adult race at 20:00. Profits from the race go towards grassroots athletics in the region - North Westmeath Athletics, Schools Cross Country, and local community games. The Castlepollard 5KM can be considered as the final major race in summer road racing in the midlands as with the fading light of the late summer comes less opportunities to hold races in the evening time. Castlepollard is a small town located in North County Westmeath amongst the lakes of Lough Lene and Lough Derravagh. One of the enduring symbols of the Castlepollard 5KM is the tireless work of Andy MacEoin of North Westmeath AC who has been a visitor to almost every road race in the Midlands and beyond over the past number of months to publicize the event. Many of the participants tonight will have seen Andy's strategically placed advertising signs around other road race routes. Certainly this work, and that of many other members of North Westmeath AC, has paid off well. 
The race begins near the center of the town square and proceeds directly out the R395 towards Coole and Edgeworthstown. The first KM is flat and quick allowing the field to spread out. The race then enters the Tullynally Castle estate and proceeds up the tree-lined avenue. The gardens, like the castle are on a grand scale, taking in nearly 12 acres. This allows the race to make a big loop of the gardens with a quick downhill stretch followed by a sharp climb before the race rejoins it's outgoing path for the final 1.5KM of the race. The final 1100M from the gate of the Castle grounds to the finish is as the first - fast and flat and allows for a great finish passing the GAA grounds with finish line just outside the local Fire Station.

One of the show pieces of the race landscape is Tullynally Castle. The name Tullynally is an adaption of 'Tulaigh an Eallaigh' – the Hill of the Swan. The hill overlooks Lough Derravaragh, the legendary lake of the Children of Lir who were turned into swans. Tullynally Castle is still a family home to this day. Details of visitor times and other information is available on the links below.

This year over 450 participants took part in the race. It goes without saying that the Castlepollard 5KM has become one of the &quot;must do&quot; road race events in the midlands. Everything that is good about club road racing in Ireland can be found here. What makes it so great? All runners who take part just say that there is something special about the race and it is a race that you have to experience to understand it. 

We have a large set of photographs from the event today. The full set is accessible at: <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/peterm7/sets/72157656750245820"">www.flickr.com/photos/peterm7/sets/72157656750245820</a> - They were taken at the start and finish of the event.

<b>USING OUR PHOTOGRAPHS - A QUICK GUIDE AND ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS</b>
<b>Can I use these photographs directly from Flickr on my social media account(s)?</b>

<b>Yes - of course you can!</b> Flickr provides several ways to <b>share</b> this and other photographs in this Flickr set. You can share directly to: email, Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, Tumblr, LiveJournal, and Wordpress and Blogger blog sites. Your mobile, tablet, or desktop device will also offer you several different options for sharing this photo page on your social media outlets. 

<b>BUT..... Wait there a minute.... </b>
We take these photographs as a hobby and as a contribution to the running community in Ireland. We do not charge for our photographs. Our only &quot;cost&quot; is that we request that if you are using these images: (1) on social media sites such as Facebook, Tumblr, Pinterest, Twitter,LinkedIn, Google+, VK.com, Vine, Meetup, Tagged, Ask.fm,etc or (2) other websites, blogs, web multimedia, commercial/promotional material that <b>you must provide a link back to our Flickr page to attribute us</b> or <b>acknowledge us</b> as the original photographers. 

This also extends to the use of these images for <b>Facebook profile pictures</b>. In these cases please make a separate wall or blog post with a link to our Flickr page. If you do not know how this should be done for Facebook or other social media please email us and we will be happy to help suggest how to link to us. 

<b>I want to download these pictures to my computer or device?</b>

You can download this photographic image here directly to your computer or device. This version is the low resolution web-quality image. How to download will vary slight from device to device and from browser to browser. Have a look for a down-arrow symbol or the link to 'View/Download' all sizes. When you click on either of these you will be presented with the option to download the image. Remember just doing a right-click and &quot;save target as&quot; will not work on Flickr. 

<b>I want get full resolution, print-quality, copies of these photographs?</b>

If you just need these photographs for online usage then they can be used directly once you respect their Creative Commons license and provide a link back to our Flickr set if you use them. For offline usage and printing all of the photographs posted here on this Flickr set are available free, at no cost, at full image resolution. 

Please email <b>petermooney78 AT gmail DOT com</b> with the links to the photographs you would like to obtain a full resolution copy of. We also ask race organisers, media, etc to ask for permission before use of our images for flyers, posters, etc. We reserve the right to refuse a request. 

<i><b>In summary please remember when requesting photographs from us</b></i> - <b>If you are using the photographs online</b> all we ask is for you to provide a link back to our Flickr set or Flickr pages. You will find the link above clearly outlined in the description text which accompanies this photograph. Taking these photographs and preparing them for online posting takes a significant effort and time. We are not posting photographs to Flickr for commercial reasons. If you really like what we do please spread the link around your social media, send us an email, leave a comment beside the photographs, send us a Flickr email, etc. <b>If you are using the photographs in newspapers or magazines</b> we ask that you mention where the original photograph came from.   

<b>I would like to contribute something for your photograph(s)?</b>
Many people offer payment for our photographs. As stated above we do not charge for these photographs. We take these photographs as our contribution to the running community in Ireland. If you feel that the photograph(s) you request are good enough that you would consider paying for their purchase from other photographic providers or in other circumstances we would suggest that you can provide a donation to any of the great charities in Ireland who do work for Cancer Care or Cancer Research in Ireland.

<b>Let's get a bit technical: We use Creative Commons Licensing for these photographs</b>
We use the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License for all our photographs here in this photograph set. What does this mean in reality?
The explaination is very simple. 
<b>Attribution</b>- anyone using our photographs gives us an appropriate credit for it. This ensures that people aren't taking our photographs and passing them off as their own. This usually just mean putting a link to our photographs somewhere on your website, blog, or Facebook where other people can see it. 
<b>ShareAlike</b> – anyone can use these photographs, and make changes if they like, or incorporate them into a bigger project, but they must make those changes available back to the community under the same terms. 

Above all what Creative Commons aims to do is to encourage creative sharing. See some examples of Creative Commons photographs on Flickr: <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/"">www.flickr.com/creativecommons/</a>

<b>I ran in the race - but my photograph doesn't appear here in your Flickr set! What gives?</b>

As mentioned above we take these photographs as a hobby and as a voluntary contribution to the running community in Ireland. Very often we have actually ran in the same race and then switched to photographer mode after we finished the race. Consequently, we feel that we have no obligations to capture a photograph of every participant in the race. However, we do try our very best to capture as many participants as possible. But this is sometimes not possible for a variety of reasons:

     ►You were hidden behind another participant as you passed our camera
     ►Weather or lighting conditions meant that we had some photographs with blurry content which we did not upload to our Flickr set
     ►There were too many people - some races attract thousands of participants and as amateur photographs we cannot hope to capture photographs of everyone
     ►We simply missed you - sorry about that - we did our best!


You can email us <b>petermooney78 AT gmail DOT com</b> to enquire if we have a photograph of you which didn't make the final Flickr selection for the race. But we cannot promise that there will be photograph there. As alternatives we advise you to contact the race organisers to enquire if there were (1) other photographs taking photographs at the race event or if (2) there were professional commercial sports photographers taking photographs which might have some photographs of you available for purchase. You might find some links for further information above.  

<b>Don't like your photograph here?</b>
That's OK! We understand! 

If, for any reason, you are not happy or comfortable with your picture appearing here in this photoset on Flickr then please email us at <b>petermooney78 AT gmail DOT com</b> and we will remove it as soon as possible. We give careful consideration to each photograph before uploading. 

<b>I want to tell people about these great photographs!</b>
Great! Thank you! The best link to spread the word around is probably <b>http://www.flickr.com/peterm7/sets</b>

The trails within this network are flowing in nature with a hard-packed surface and fine grain soils. Most of the system is located on routes that climb to and traverse long and scenic ridgelines. The Wind River mountain range is visible on the western side of the system. The trails wind and meander through typical Great Basin terrain that ranges from clusters of pinyon-juniper woodlands and open sagebrush meadows.

This grove is notable because it allows for the use of self-guided tours of the flat, 0.8-mile (1.3 km) loop trail which is easily accessible (within 150 feet (46 m) of a vehicle parking lot). Dozens of large, old Redwood trees are located within a few feet of the walking trail.

Coast Redwoods, (Sequoia sempervirens), are a native tree in the deep valleys and low to middle elevations (up to 750 m) of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Their growth and longevity is enhanced by the proximity to the ocean with its massive amounts of precipitation, the cool air which encourages fog, and the dimmer sunlight near the moisture-rich trunk-base region. Free-flowing, year-round stream help to enhance this environment and the cool, moisture-laden air often produces visible fog, which helps to replenish the trees. The bark of these giants is heavily laden with tannin, which helps to offer protection from damage by either fires or insects.

This grove has some of the tallest and oldest trees in the Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park, because the environment has been preserved to maintain a natural ecology. Undergrowth is never cleared, there is no logging allowed and deadfalls and lightning-struck trees are allowed to proceed naturally with their processes, unless they impair access to the grove. This rich, biotic environment is filled with natural nutrients which make up for the massive amounts of waterfall which might otherwise deplete the soil. Old growth groves such as this will show the birth (shoots and burls) and death (rotting trees and &quot;fairy rings&quot;) of ancient redwoods, many of whose birth was before the Battle of Hastings in 1066.

Of course, all the native flora and fauna which have existed in these mountains for centuries are allowed to remain—even to the extent of the highly irritating poison oak plants.

This part of the California coastline was once a tribal area for the Awaswas (Santa Cruz) division of Ohlone Indian people. In 1769, Gaspar de Portolà camped on the banks of the San Lorenzo River and erected a wooden cross to mark the location as part of his exploration for Spain. This exploration offered the peoples of this richly, resourced area, known as Alta California, to be brought under Catholicism by the Friars Minor. Little more than twenty years later, in 1791, a Catholic mission, Mission Santa Cruz was consecrated nearby. This mission, served as a site for ecclesiastical conversion of natives. From 1805 to 1812, the mission was run by Father Andrés Quintana who was one of only two Spanish missionaries martyred in Alta California.

After the Mexican War of Independence in 1821, the newly independent Mexico assumed control of this area until the transfer to the United States in 1846. During Mexican ownership, it was common for land grants to be sold to those who were in favor with the government. Large portions of this virgin-forested area were given out as Rancho Carbonera, Rancho Zayante and Rancho Cañada del Rincon en el Rio San Lorenzo. These &quot;gifted&quot; land grants were the start of European settlement in the area that is now known as Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park. In 1843, the Mexican Government granted a parcel of 8,800 acres (36 km2) under the name of Rancho Cañada del Rincon en el Rio San Lorenzo de Santa Cruz to a French immigrant named Pedro Sansevain. This grant essentially encompassed what is today known as the Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park. After a few transfers of land over about twenty years, the granted Rancho Cañada del Rincon ended up in the hands of Henry Cowell.

You save what’s worth salvaging and shield the damaged parts with reinforced metal. You strive to find the middle ground between showing you have nothing to hide, and just showing off. You carefully curate your interests as if they were co-op displays in a Barnes &amp; Noble, reveling in the understated complexity of liking both Nicki Minaj and My Bloody Valentine. Your picture gallery broadcasts a series of defensive messages: “See? Other females aren’t afraid of me.” “See? I go to museums sometimes and mimic sculpture-poses because Culture.” “See? I’ve been to a Halloween party so obviously I don’t spend much time alone, crying to The Cure’s Disintegration LP and drinking wine from a can.” Dating profiles reveal more about how you see yourself than how you really are, and more about how you want to be seen than how you will be.” —Joe Berkowitz &amp; Joanna Neborsky

The earliest information found dates back to when the land was a plantation, called Crab Orchard back in the 1820s, due to the many crab apple trees located on the property. It was owned by William Jemison, who then passed it down to his son, Robert Jemison Jr., a successful politician and businessman. The 4,000 acre tract in Northport was later known as Cherokee Place, where Robert would live until his new home was completed in Tuscaloosa in 1862. Jemison was a major advocate for the establishment of a hospital for the insane in Alabama, and is considered a major influence to select the area as the site for the first asylum in the state - the Alabama State Hospital for the Insane (Bryce Hospital).

By the 1920s the asylum had become severely overcrowded, and satellite institutions were created nearby to relieve the pressure, such as the Alabama Home for Mental Defectives (later known as Partlow State School). In 1939, the site of the Cherokee Plantation was purchased and transformed into the State Farm Colony for Negroes (the old Bryce Hospital grounds only housed white patients during the Jim Crow era). The former plantation house on the hill was razed and in its place the state of Alabama constructed the Jemison Institute, a three-story brick institution with detached heating plant for $161,000.

History seems to fade from there; it's assumed the Jemison Center operated as a state work farm, where able-bodied African American patients would work the fields to produce food for the hospital, as well as performing other kinds of labor (weaving, mending, etc). Desegregation orders from the government and changes in labor laws seemed to put an end to the Jemison Center; all farming operations at Bryce ceased in 1977. A mid-19th century structure was also erected on the property, called the S.D. Allen Intermediate Care Facility; it was used as a nursing home until it closed in 2003.

It is located about 10 meters northwest of Thumb Geyser.  Waterfall Geyser first appeared in August 2016, erupting from a pre-established, inactive spring.  The basin enlarged considerably from late 2016 to May 2017.  Eruptions produce a fair amount of water, much of which cascades over a rocky outcrop (&quot;waterfall&quot;) into Thumb Geyser's basin, which fills up and sometimes overflows and spreads out.

In August 2016, Waterfall Geyser eruptions had intervals (= eruption start to eruption start) of 3 to 4 hours.  Reported eruption durations in 2016 and 2017 range from 8 minutes to over 1 hour.  Eruption spouting reaches up to an estimated 6 to 8 feet high.  One eruption was reported as reaching about 20 feet high.

Shown above is Waterfall Geyser during an eruption on 5 June 2017.  Just before the eruption started, the basin's water level rose and swamped three smaller features to the west.

<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospices_de_Beaune"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">Hôtel-Dieu</a>

The Hospices de Beaune or Hôtel-Dieu de Beaune is a former charitable almshouse in Beaune, France. It was founded in 1443 by Nicolas Rolin, chancellor of Burgundy, as a hospital for the poor. The original hospital building, the Hôtel-Dieu, one of the finest examples of French fifteenth-century architecture, is now a museum. Services for patients are now provided in modern hospital buildings.

An important charity wine auction is held in November each year (formerly in the great hall of the Hôtel-Dieu).


The Hôtel-Dieu was founded on 4 August 1443, when Burgundy was ruled by Duke Philip the Good. The Hundred Years' War had recently been brought to a close by the signing of the Treaty of Arras in 1435. Massacres, however, continued with marauding bands (écorcheurs) still roaming the countryside, pillaging and destroying, provoking misery and famine. The majority of the people of Beaune were declared destitute. Nicolas Rolin, the Duke's Chancellor, and his wife Guigone de Salins, responded by building a hospital and refuge for the poor.The majority of the population of Beaune were destitute, and the area had recently suffered an outbreak of plague. Having gained permission from Pope Eugene IV in 1441, the hospice was built and consecrated on 31 December 1452. In conjunction, Rolin established the &quot;Les sœurs hospitalières de Beaune&quot; religious order.

The building's design was probably overseen by the Flemish architect Jacques Wiscrère and remained as a hospital until the late 1970s. There is a documentary record of a large range of Flemish and French masons, painters and glass cutters employed for its construction. The facade is today regarded as a superior example of Northern Renaissance civic architecture and a treasure trove of panel painting, given its numerous portraits of Rolin, his wife and members of his extended family.

The Hospices de Beaune consists of a pair of two-storied buildings arranged around a stone courtyard. The building wings are well-preserved today; they contain half-timber galleries and ornate rooftops with dormer windows. The hospital is arranged so that the wings served the office, kitchen and apothecary functions. The nuns and patients were housed nearer the chapel, towards the center of the complex.

The Hospices de Beaune received the first patient on 1 January 1452. Elderly, disabled and sick people, with orphans, women about to give birth and the destitute have all been uninterruptedly welcomed for treatment and refuge from the Middle Ages until today. This Catholic institution focused on healing both the body and spirit of its patients.

Over the centuries, the hospital radiated outwards, grouping with similar establishments in the surrounding villages of Pommard, Nolay, Meursault. Many donations - farms, property, woods, works of art and of course vineyards - were made to it, by grateful families and generous benefactors. The institution is one of the best and oldest examples of historical, philanthropic, and wine-producing heritage, and has become linked with the economic and cultural life of Burgundy.","https://live.staticflickr.com/4250/35344932605_e8d1c3de9e_o.jpg","[{""name"":""Elliott Brown"",""url"":null}]","by-sa","vineyard","jpeg","https://www.flickr.com/","2017-06-06","4608x3456"

"https://www.flickr.com/photos/peterm7/36570291676/","Castlepollard 5km 2017 | This is a photograph is from a set … | Flickr","This is a photograph is from a set of photographs from the Castlepollard 5KM Road Race and Fun Run 2017, also known as the Tullynally Challenge, which was held in Castlepollard, Co. Westmeath, Ireland on Wednesday 16th August 2017 at 20:00. The race is hosted by North Westmeath Athletic Club. The weather was reasonably good for road racing. The participants had a very stiff breeze in their faces on the outward stretch and all the way to the 2KM mark within Tullynally. This then became a helpful tailwail for the final KM of the race. 

Starting off many years ago the race was very much a local affair drawing runners from the sounding areas of Mullingar, North East Meath, Cavan, and Longford. However, the race has grown in stature and popularity over the years and is now one of the most well attended road races in the midlands and sees participants from all over Ireland. The race offers prizes in all categories. The Castlepollard 5KM Road Race attempts to support young runners and walkers by organising a range of underage races around the town square before the adult race at 20:00. Profits from the race go towards grassroots athletics in the region - North Westmeath Athletics, Schools Cross Country, and local community games. As summer moves into autumn the Castlepollard 5KM can be considered as the unofficial ending of summer evening road racing in the midlands as with the fading light of the late summer evenings comes less opportunities to hold races in the evening time. Castlepollard is a small town located in North County Westmeath amongst the lakes of Lough Lene and Lough Derravagh. One of the show pieces of the race landscape is Tullynally Castle which provides almost 2.5KM of the race route. The name Tullynally is an adaption of 'Tulaigh an Eallaigh' – the Hill of the Swan. The hill overlooks the mythical Lough Derravaragh. Irish folklore legend names the lake as where the Children of Lir, who were turned into swans, were destined to live for 300 years. Tullynally Castle is still a family home to this day. 


One of the enduring symbols of the Castlepollard 5KM is the tireless work of Andy MacEoin of North Westmeath AC who has been a visitor to almost every road race in the Midlands and beyond over the past number of months to publicize the event. Many of the participants tonight will have seen Andy's strategically placed advertising signs around other road race routes. Certainly this work, and that of many other members of North Westmeath AC, has paid off well.

The race begins near the center of the town square and proceeds directly out the R395 towards Coole and Edgeworthstown. The first KM is flat and quick allowing the field to spread out. The race then enters the Tullynally Castle estate and proceeds up the tree-lined avenue. The gardens, like the castle are on a grand scale, taking in nearly 12 acres. This allows the race to make a big loop of the gardens with a quick downhill stretch followed by a sharp climb before the race rejoins it's outgoing path for the final 1.5KM of the race. The final 1100M from the gate of the Castle grounds to the finish is as the first - fast and flat and allows for a great finish passing the GAA grounds with finish line just outside the local Fire Station.
 

This year almost 400 took part in the race. It goes without saying that the Castlepollard 5KM has become one of the &quot;must do&quot; road race events in the midlands. Everything that is good about club road racing in Ireland can be found here.

<b>I ran in the race - but my photograph doesn't appear here in your Flickr set! What gives?</b>

As mentioned above we take these photographs as a hobby and as a voluntary contribution to the running community in Ireland. Very often we have actually ran in the same race and then switched to photographer mode after we finished the race. Consequently, we feel that we have no obligations to capture a photograph of every participant in the race. However, we do try our very best to capture as many participants as possible. But this is sometimes not possible for a variety of reasons:

     ►You were hidden behind another participant as you passed our camera
     ►Weather or lighting conditions meant that we had some photographs with blurry content which we did not upload to our Flickr set
     ►There were too many people - some races attract thousands of participants and as amateur photographs we cannot hope to capture photographs of everyone
     ►We simply missed you - sorry about that - we did our best!


You can email us <b>petermooney78 AT gmail DOT com</b> to enquire if we have a photograph of you which didn't make the final Flickr selection for the race. But we cannot promise that there will be photograph there. As alternatives we advise you to contact the race organisers to enquire if there were (1) other photographs taking photographs at the race event or if (2) there were professional commercial sports photographers taking photographs which might have some photographs of you available for purchase. You might find some links for further information above.  

<b>Don't like your photograph here?</b>
That's OK! We understand!

Westmeath, Ireland on Wednesday 16th August 2017 at 20:00. The race is hosted by North Westmeath Athletic Club. The weather was reasonably good for road racing. The participants had a very stiff breeze in their faces on the outward stretch and all the way to the 2KM mark within Tullynally. This then became a helpful tailwail for the final KM of the race. 

Starting off many years ago the race was very much a local affair drawing runners from the sounding areas of Mullingar, North East Meath, Cavan, and Longford. However, the race has grown in stature and popularity over the years and is now one of the most well attended road races in the midlands and sees participants from all over Ireland. The race offers prizes in all categories. The Castlepollard 5KM Road Race attempts to support young runners and walkers by organising a range of underage races around the town square before the adult race at 20:00. Profits from the race go towards grassroots athletics in the region - North Westmeath Athletics, Schools Cross Country, and local community games. As summer moves into autumn the Castlepollard 5KM can be considered as the unofficial ending of summer evening road racing in the midlands as with the fading light of the late summer evenings comes less opportunities to hold races in the evening time. Castlepollard is a small town located in North County Westmeath amongst the lakes of Lough Lene and Lough Derravagh. One of the show pieces of the race landscape is Tullynally Castle which provides almost 2.5KM of the race route. The name Tullynally is an adaption of 'Tulaigh an Eallaigh' – the Hill of the Swan. The hill overlooks the mythical Lough Derravaragh. Irish folklore legend names the lake as where the Children of Lir, who were turned into swans, were destined to live for 300 years. Tullynally Castle is still a family home to this day. 


One of the enduring symbols of the Castlepollard 5KM is the tireless work of Andy MacEoin of North Westmeath AC who has been a visitor to almost every road race in the Midlands and beyond over the past number of months to publicize the event. Many of the participants tonight will have seen Andy's strategically placed advertising signs around other road race routes. Certainly this work, and that of many other members of North Westmeath AC, has paid off well.

The race begins near the center of the town square and proceeds directly out the R395 towards Coole and Edgeworthstown. The first KM is flat and quick allowing the field to spread out. The race then enters the Tullynally Castle estate and proceeds up the tree-lined avenue. The gardens, like the castle are on a grand scale, taking in nearly 12 acres. This allows the race to make a big loop of the gardens with a quick downhill stretch followed by a sharp climb before the race rejoins it's outgoing path for the final 1.5KM of the race. The final 1100M from the gate of the Castle grounds to the finish is as the first - fast and flat and allows for a great finish passing the GAA grounds with finish line just outside the local Fire Station.
 

This year almost 400 took part in the race. It goes without saying that the Castlepollard 5KM has become one of the &quot;must do&quot; road race events in the midlands. Everything that is good about club road racing in Ireland can be found here.

Meath, Ireland on Sunday 22nd October 2017 at 11:00. The races are held annually to support the development of the local GAA club while also supporting local charities. The race has support from Trim AC which sees the race have full AAI premit status. These races have grown steadily over the years and this year almost 400 participants to part in the two races. This is an impressive statistic given that a very large number of local runners will be preparing for the Dublin City marathon 7 days from now. However both races provide marathon runners and all other runners, joggers and walkers with an ideal opportunity to race on a very fair course in a beautiful rural setting. Barry Clarke of Longwood GAA and Trim AC and his very large group of volunteers deserve the highest of praise for the very high standard of organisation immediately apparent to anyone taking part in the race. Overall the whole day was a great success with the hard work put in by the organising committee ensuring that participants enjoyed their race experience. Both routes were accurately measured, kilometer points clearly marked, junctions well stewarded, and electronic timing provided. The event provided many local runners, joggers, fun runners and walkers with a local event to support whilst at the same time providing runners preparing for events such as the Dublin marathon with an opportunity to race a short, fast, distance in the lead up to marathon day. The GAA club provided excellent stewarding and traffic management all around the course. The race had a professional feel to it and it is sure to grow next year given the very positive feedback from many of the participants today. The weather in the week leading up to the race was hardly ideal with both Storm Ophelia and Storm Brian bringing windy and rainy conditions to Ireland all week. The weather for race day was more suitable for running. Dry, with a fresh breeze, the weather remained dry for both races with the sun making an appearance also.

Longwood is a small village in South East Co. Meath and is close to the town of Enfield with access to the M4 Motorway. 

5KM Course: The 5KM started in Longwood village. Runners then took a left turn in the Village down St. Oliver's Road. This straight section of road brings runners to a left turn onto a very well maintained boreen road for less than one kilometer. The race then emerges and joins with the 10KM at Stoneyford where the runners take a left and then another left before arriving back at the finish line in Longwood GAA club. Overall this is a very fast and flat 5KM with no hills to speak of.

10KM Course: The 10KM event begins in Longwood Village outside Dargan's Pub and proceeds westward out of the village. There are some interesting points along this part of the course. At the 2KM point the runners will run under the double bridges - an aquaduct for the Royal Canal and a bridge carrying the Dublin Sligo Railway line. The race then enters county Kildare just before the 3km and after taking a right turn at the four-cross roads known locally as Lally's Cross it returns to County Meath on top of the River Boyne Bridge (Ashfield Bridge) which forms the county boundary. The race follows a straight road for the next 2KM until runners encounter Blackshade bridge which is the toughest climb on the route. As a point of interest Blackshade bridge brings runners back over the Royal Canal and the Railway line. The race then crosses the River Boyne again at Stoneyford before taking a right which will bring runners on a testing two kilometer stretch with some short hills. The 10KM course then joins with the 5Km course for the final 1.5KM back to Longwood GAA club for the finish.

Please email <b>petermooney78 AT gmail DOT com</b> with the links to the photographs you would like to obtain a full resolution copy of. We also ask race organisers, media, etc to ask for permission before use of our images for flyers, posters, etc. We reserve the right to refuse a request. 

<i><b>In summary please remember when requesting photographs from us</b></i> - <b>If you are using the photographs online</b> all we ask is for you to provide a link back to our Flickr set or Flickr pages. You will find the link above clearly outlined in the description text which accompanies this photograph. Taking these photographs and preparing them for online posting takes a significant effort and time. We are not posting photographs to Flickr for commercial reasons. If you really like what we do please spread the link around your social media, send us an email, leave a comment beside the photographs, send us a Flickr email, etc. <b>If you are using the photographs in newspapers or magazines</b> we ask that you mention where the original photograph came from.   

<b>I would like to contribute something for your photograph(s)?</b>
Many people offer payment for our photographs. As stated above we do not charge for these photographs. We take these photographs as our contribution to the running community in Ireland.

<b>Let's get a bit technical: We use Creative Commons Licensing for these photographs</b>

The explaination is very simple. 
<b>Attribution</b>- anyone using our photographs gives us an appropriate credit for it. This ensures that people aren't taking our photographs and passing them off as their own. This usually just mean putting a link to our photographs somewhere on your website, blog, or Facebook where other people can see it.

Above all what Creative Commons aims to do is to encourage creative sharing. See some examples of Creative Commons photographs on Flickr: <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/"">www.flickr.com/creativecommons/</a>

<b>I ran in the race - but my photograph doesn't appear here in your Flickr set! What gives?</b>

As mentioned above we take these photographs as a hobby and as a voluntary contribution to the running community in Ireland. Very often we have actually ran in the same race and then switched to photographer mode after we finished the race. Consequently, we feel that we have no obligations to capture a photograph of every participant in the race. However, we do try our very best to capture as many participants as possible. But this is sometimes not possible for a variety of reasons:

     ►You were hidden behind another participant as you passed our camera
     ►Weather or lighting conditions meant that we had some photographs with blurry content which we did not upload to our Flickr set
     ►There were too many people - some races attract thousands of participants and as amateur photographs we cannot hope to capture photographs of everyone
     ►We simply missed you - sorry about that - we did our best!


You can email us <b>petermooney78 AT gmail DOT com</b> to enquire if we have a photograph of you which didn't make the final Flickr selection for the race. But we cannot promise that there will be photograph there. As alternatives we advise you to contact the race organisers to enquire if there were (1) other photographs taking photographs at the race event or if (2) there were professional commercial sports photographers taking photographs which might have some photographs of you available for purchase. You might find some links for further information above.  

<b>Don't like your photograph here?</b>
That's OK! We understand! 

If, for any reason, you are not happy or comfortable with your picture appearing here in this photoset on Flickr then please email us at <b>petermooney78 AT gmail DOT com</b> and we will remove it as soon as possible. We give careful consideration to each photograph before uploading. 

<b>I want to tell people about these great photographs!</b>
Great! Thank you! The best link to spread the word around is probably <b>http://www.flickr.com/peterm7/sets</b>

"https://www.flickr.com/photos/naivepaintings/39254487862/","לוח שנה בהוצאת מגזין הקהילה הגאה הזמן הורוד raphael perez … | Flickr","A full interview with the Israeli painter Raphael Perez (in Hebrew Rafi Peretz) about the ideas behind the naive painting, resume, personal biography and CV
Question: Raphael Perez Tell us about your work process as a naive painter?
Answer: I choose the most iconic and famous buildings in every city and town that are architecturally interesting and have a special shape and place the iconic buildings on boulevards full of trees, bushes, vegetation, flowers.

Question: How do you give depth in your naive paintings?
Answer: To give depth to the painting, I build the painting with layers of vegetation, after those low famous buildings, followed by a tall avenue of trees, and behind them towers and skyscrapers, in the sky I sometimes put innocent signs of balloons, kites.
A recurring motif in some of my paintings is the figure of the painter who is in the center of the boulevard and paints the entire scene unfolding in front of him, also there are two kindergarten teachers who are walking with the kindergarten children with the state flags that I paint, and loving couples hugging and kissing and family paintings of mother, father and child walking in harmony on the boulevard.

Question: Raphael Perez What characterizes your naive painting?
Answer: Most naive paintings have the same characteristics
(Definition as it appears in Wikipedia)
• Tells a simple story to absorb from everyday life, usually with humans.
• The representation of the painter's idealization to reality - the mapping of reality.
• Failure to maintain perspective - especially details even in distant details.
• Extensive use of repeating patterns - many details.
• Warm and bright colors.
• Sometimes the emphasis is on outlines.
• Most of the characters are flat, lack volume
• No interest in texture, expression, correct proportions
• No interest in anatomy.
• There is not much use of light and shadow, the colors create a three-dimensional effect.
I find these definitions to be valid for all my naive paintings

Question: Raphael Perez Why do you mainly choose the city of Tel Aviv?
Answer: I was born in Jerusalem, the capital city which I love very much and also paint,
I love the special Bauhaus buildings in Tel Aviv, the ornamental buildings that were built a century ago in the 1920s and 1930s, the beautiful boulevards, towers and modern skyscrapers give you the feeling of the hustle and bustle of a large metropolis and there are quite a few low and tall buildings that are architecturally fascinating in their form the special one
Also, the move to Tel Aviv, which is the capital of culture, freedom, and secularism, allowed me to live my life as I chose, to live in a relationship with a man, Jerusalem, which is a traditional city, it is more complicated to live a homosexual life, also, the art world takes place mainly in the city of Tel Aviv, and it is possible that from a professional point of view, this allows I can support myself better in Tel Aviv than in any other city in Israel.

Question: raphael perez are the paintings of the city of Tel Aviv different from the paintings of the city of Jerusalem
Answer: Most of the paintings of Jerusalem have an emphasis on the color yellow, gold, the color of the old city walls, the subjects I painted in Jerusalem are mainly a type of idealization of a peaceful life between Jews and Arabs and paintings that deal with the Jewish religious world, a number of paintings depict all shades of the currents of Judaism of today
In contrast, the Tel Aviv paintings are more colorful, with skyscrapers, the sea, balloons and more secular motifs

Question: Raphael Perez Tell us about which buildings and their architects you usually choose in your city paintings
Answer: My favorite buildings are those that have a special shape that anyone can recognize and are the symbols of the city and you will give several examples:
In the city of Tel Aviv, my favorite buildings are: the opera building with its unusual geometric shape, the Yisrotel tower with its special head, the Hail Bo Shalom tower that for years was the symbol of the tallest building in Tel Aviv, the Levin house that looks like a Japanese pagoda, the burgundy-colored Nordeau hotel with the special dome at the end of the building, A pair of Alon towers with the special structure of the sea, Bauhaus buildings typical of Tel Aviv with the special balconies and the special staircase, the Yaakov Agam fountain in Dizengoff square appears in a large part of the paintings, many towers that are in the stock exchange complex, the Aviv towers and other tall buildings on Ayalon, in some of the paintings I took plans An outline of future buildings that need to be built in the city and I drew them even before they were built in reality,

In the paintings of Jerusalem, I mainly chose the area of the Old City and East Jerusalem, a painting of the walls of the Old City, the Western Wall, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, the El Akchea Mosque, the Tower of David, most of the famous churches in the city, the right hand of Moses, in most of the paintings the Jew is wearing a blue shirt with a red male cord I was in the youth movement and the Arab with a galabia, and in the paintings of the religious public then, Jews with black suits and white shirts, tallitas, kippahs, special hats, synagogues and more

I also created three paintings of the city of Haifa and one painting of Safed
In the Haifa paintings I drew the university, the Technion, the famous Egged Tower, the Sail Tower, well-known hotels, of course the Baha'i Gardens and the Baha'i Temple, Haifa Port and the boats and other famous buildings in the city

Question: Have you created series of other cities from around the world?
Answer: I created series of New York City with all the iconic and famous buildings such as: the Guggenheim Museum, the famous skyscrapers - the Chrysler Building, the Empire State Building, Lincoln Center, the famous synagogue in the city, the Statue of Liberty, the flags of the United States and other famous buildings
Two paintings of London and all its famous sites, Big Ben, famous monuments, the Ferris wheel, Queen Elizabeth and her family, the double bus, the famous public telephone, palaces, famous churches, well-known monuments
I created 4 naive paintings of cities in China, a painting of Shanghai, two paintings of the city of Suzhou and a painting of the World Park in the city of Beijing... I chose the famous skyline of Shanghai with all the famous towers, the famous promenade, temples and old buildings, two Paintings of the city of Suzhou with the famous canals, bridges, special gardens, towers and skyscrapers of the city","https://live.staticflickr.com/4641/39254487862_f3aa441045_o.jpg","[{""name"":""Raphael Perez  Israeli Artist"",""url"":null}]","by","Statue of Liberty","jpeg","https://www.flickr.com/","2017-12-25","700x821"

The story goes that the daughter of Count Arnaud started the Historic French Quarter Parade close to 100 years ago. Today the parade starts at 9:45 a.m. at Antoine's Restaurant (715 Rue St. Louis). It includes a stop for the 11 a.m. mass at the St. Louis Cathedral and resume parading at noon after a promenade in Jackson Square.

The parade features stylish ladies in lovely hats handing out goodies via both carriages and convertibles and disbands in front of Antoine's where the ladies promenade through the main dining room handing out stuffed bunnies and Easter trinkets to the patrons.

Easter Sunday's lineup of parades starts early that  morning with The Historic French Quarter Easter Parade from Antoine's  Restaurant  at 9:45 a.m. to St. Louis Cathedral for 11:00  a.m. Mass. The parade, consisting largely of mule-drawn carriages and old convertibles,  makes its leisurely, roundabout way through the French Quarter, handing out  stuffed Easter bunnies to the kids, along with other trinkets.

Following Mass, participants in the parade  promenade to Jackson Square opposite the Cathedral to show off their Easter bonnets  and other finery before returning to Antoine's. Awards are given out for the  best Easter bonnets, Easter baskets and overall Easter attire.

Later, around 1:00 p.m. is the Chris Owens French Quarter Easter Parade.  This tradition, which began back in the early 1980s, features renowned French  Quarter singer, dancer and all-around entertainer Chris Owens as the Grand  Duchess. She stands proudly on her gaily decorated float, assisted by elegantly  attired attendants while decked out in one of her stunning, tight-fitting  outfits.

The parade starts at the corner of Canal and  Bourbon streets and makes its way through the French Quarter, past the Chris  Owens Club at 500 Bourbon, with colorful floats and vintage convertibles and  accompanied by one or more of the city's famous brass bands. Plus dance groups  and other entertainers. And, of course, since this is a New Orleans parade,  there will be plenty of throws - Easter-themed - to catch from the floats and  the open-top cars. This parade is a sight you'll never forget!

Then, later in the  afternoon, is yet another parade, the Gay Easter Parade, put on by the city's GLBT community. Being nowhere near as  wild or extravagant as a Mardi Gras parade, but rather family-friendly, the Gay Easter Parade takes a leisurely route through the  French Quarter, passing every gay bar and many gay-owned restaurants and retail  shops. The paraders ride horse-drawn carriages or floats while wearing showy  versions of their Easter Sunday finest. Don't be surprised if you see a gaggle  of motorcycle dudes in leather and Easter bonnets might roar by. Spectators can  expect to see (and catch!) plenty of beads and other throws.

"https://www.flickr.com/photos/infomatique/41915803532/","I NOW BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE PET GRAVES [MAYNOOTH COLLEGE]… | Flickr","I have visited the old graveyard in Maynooth College an number of times and for the first time a few years ago I noticed a wooden cross in the woods beside the outer wall of the graveyard. I was interested because if this cross was a burial-marker it would indicate that for some reason a person was not permitted to be buried in a consecrated graveyard [there are many possible reasons which I will not discuss here … see link below]. 

Back then I asked a number of people about this cross and anyone that was aware of it did not know its history, one person suggested that it might be a pet’s grave but that some people believed that it marked the grave of a person who committed suicide. There is now [7 May 2018] and extra wooden cross so there is no real reason to believe that they are anything other than pet grave markers.

I came across the following story: “If you visit Maynooth today, you might come across an old building on the campus called Rhetoric House. You might notice that one of the windows on the top floor is boarded-up and you might wonder why. If you ask someone, they will tell you this is The Ghost Room. Many years ago, students who went to Maynooth would live on the top floor of the building. There was one young man who was assigned to sleep in Room No.2. One day, when he didn’t show up for lectures, his friends went looking for him. They found his dead body lying in a pool of blood on the floor of Room No.2 with his throat slit from ear to ear. Clutched in his hand was a bloody razor and it appeared that he had taken his own life. Ireland was a Catholic country and, at the time, suicide was seen as a terrible sin. The matter was hushed up by the college and the student was buried in an unconsecrated part of the college cemetery, away from the other graves.” 

As you may have guessed, according to local legend, this story repeated the next year [according to the official records the deaths were nineteen years apart]. Some locals claim, that three people died in a similar manner but while the official records indicate that two students are buried in  unmarked graves within the walls of the graveyard there is no mention of a third student so it is claimed be a few that the wooden cross marks the grave of the third victim. 

The wooden crosses in my photographs do certainly not mark the last resting place of the third student [I just ruined a good story].

Feeling free and at home in your neighborhood, town or city. Be and show yourself in the streets. Holding hands with the person you love and smiling at each other in public. Our personal lives occur in the public space. Considering the approaching communal elections, everyone (youngsters, seniors, families, couples and all people - no matter what gender or orientation) asks the local politicians: How do you make a difference? What do you do to improve diversity in our everyday life? Where the rain makes way for the sun, we will walk proudly under the rainbow!

We will all be heading to the voting booths for the local elections on 14th of October. Deciding which circle to colour in is an important decision. A conscious decision can lead to a better living environment in your city or municipality.

And we're not just talking about the redesign of the local park, the policies in the municipal school, or the proper functioning of the local Public Centre for Social Welfare. Your local municipal or city administration can also make a real difference and turn the place where you live into a true rainbow bubble, if that's what you'd like, of course.

So it's no wonder that this year's Pride is focusing on the local elections. Belgian Pride is putting the municipalities and cities in the limelight in 2018, or better yet, at the end of the rainbow! We want the slogan 'Your Local Power!' to encourage municipal and city administrations to enact explicit, integrated local LGBTI+ policies.

Municipalities and cities can and must make the difference. They must accept responsibility for the well-being of all their residents. Flying the rainbow flag at the local government offices during the Pride period is a symbol of this. This is also a way that the municipality or city can show their solidarity with the LGBTI+ community. This symbolic gesture is not an infringement on neutrality. On the contrary, we can only actively work on ending all forms of discrimination once there is recognition for diversity and inclusion.

Policy-makers can make the lives of many citizens that much rosier by taking both small and large actions: by introducing a diversity charter in sports clubs, by making information on gender and sexuality available at the local libraries, by providing logistical and financial support to local associations, testimonials, and courses in the municipal education system, by holding a queer film festival in the local movie theatre or cultural centre, by holding LGBTI+ actions in community centres and youth centres, by providing information on what to do if you are the victim or witness of discrimination, by offering space for intimacy and (LGBTI+) sexuality in assisted-living centres, by training local police precincts and municipal officials, by including Equal Opportunity as an explicit competence within the city administration, etc.

The list of things that cities and municipalities can do is endless. Plus, many of these actions are very easy to implement. Sometimes, your local administration only needs a little boost, and you can give them that boost in the voting booth on 14th of October. A good local administration meets the needs and requirements of all residents. What does the LGBTI+ community in your city or municipality need?

You can already send the politicians a signal that is loud and clear on Saturday, the 19th of May. Make your wishes heard during the Belgian Pride.

We hope to see you there! Everyone is welcome!

It was designated a Chicago Landmark on February 27, 2002. The district includes numerous significant buildings on Michigan Avenue facing Grant Park. In addition, this section of Michigan Avenue includes the point recognized as the end of U.S. Route 66. This district is one of the world's best known one-sided streets rivalling Fifth Avenue in New York City and Edinburgh's Princes Street. It lies immediately south of the Michigan–Wacker Historic District and east of the Loop Retail Historic District.

Новый бетонный скейт парк #FKramps построен в Чебоксарах! Проект реализован по заказу крупного девелопера и расположен в микрорайоне Новый город, по дороге в Новочебоксарск. Бетонный скейт парк Новый город в Чебоксарах располагает насыщенной стрит-секцией и двухуровневым пулом (1,4 – 1,7м). Конфигурация фигур скейтпарка разработана для проведения тренировок спортсменов основных экстремальных дисциплин и подходит для райдеров любого уровня подготовки.

Примечательной особенностью проекта является наличие первого бетонного пула в Поволжье. Это специальная фигура, выполненная в виде чаши для непрерывного катания и исполнения трюков. Катание в сухих бассейнах заброшенных домов Калифорнии на доске с колесами от роликовых коньков стало прародителем современного движения скейтбординга. Мы уверены, что появление подобной фигуры в Чебоксарах положительно скажется на уровне подготовки местных райдеров к предстоящим соревнованиям общероссийского и международного масштабов.

Фигуры скейтпарка выполнены из пигментированного бетона. При строительстве была применена технология несъемной металлической опалубки. Все металлические элементы конструкции были произведены на заводе FK-ramps.

Рады отметить, что бетонные скейтпарки все чаще становятся важной частью благоустройства жилых комплексов в регионах нашей страны. Несмотря на близость жилых домов, размещение бетонного скейтпарка является предпочтительным способом обустройства подростковых площадок. Бетонный скейт парк Новый город в Чебоксарах уже в самое ближайшее время станет новым центром притяжения горожан. Практика показывает, что обустройство долговечных железобетонных скейтпарков является экономически целесообразным методом благоустройства жилых комплексов ввиду дешевого обслуживания и долговечности данного типа молодежных спортивных комплексов.","https://live.staticflickr.com/4897/40053757653_bea4863b20_o.jpg","[{""name"":""FK-ramps"",""url"":null}]","by","skatepark","jpeg","https://www.flickr.com/","2018-07-14","1920x1280"

A scenic drive along the Molalla River offers easy river access and opportunities for picnicking, swimming, camping, whitewater boating and fishing. The Molalla is one of the few undammed tributaries of the Willamette River and cuts a picturesque gorge on its way to the valley floor. 

The Molalla River Recreation Area is located approximately 10 miles southeast of Molalla in Clackamas County. From the town of Molalla, drive east on Main St/OR 211. Veer right at the OR 211/Mathias Road intersection, follow signs for Feyrer Park. Once past Feyrer Park, cross over the Molalla River, turn right, and follow signs for Dickey Prairie Rd. Continue south on Dickey Prairie Rd, keeping the Dickey Prairie Store on your left. At 3.7 miles past the store, turn right on Molalla Forest Rd and cross Glen Avon Bridge.

The Molalla River Trail System is an extensive network of more than 20 miles of trails for hikers, bicyclists and equestrians. The system combines both single track trails and old forest roads. The trails wind through the forested foothills and slopes of the Molalla River Valley, occasionally offering scenic glimpses of the forests and mountains of the Cascade Range. The system offers a variety of difficulty levels for a wide range of mountain biking, hiking and horseback riding enthusiasts. Trails are generally marked with directional signs and levels of difficulty. The best equestrian access to the trail system is from Hardy Creek or Annie’s Cabin Trailheads where there is ample parking for horse trailers. Mountain bikers and hikers may prefer to access the trail system via Amanda’s, AmeriCorps, and Sandquist ’s Trailheads.

Galway, Ireland. Just under 1,200 participants started at Athenry Railway station and finished the race today under the beautiful Medieval Arch in the town. The weather was almost perfect for road running. Conditions were very favourable with little or no breeze and cool crisp air. The winter sun also appeared. All in all this was probably the best weather for many years at the race. 

 
This is one of the leading 10KM road races in Ireland. It would seem it has been around for much longer but the race in terms of history is sill rather young at its 17th year. The superb organisation, atmosphere, and great course gives it the characteristic of a race that is many years older. The credit for this goes to the wonderful athletics club in Athenry AC and the team of volunteers. The attention to every detail in the race which this year attracted over 1,200 participants means that the race has earned its stripes as one of the leading road races in Ireland. To attract such a big field on St. Stephen's day with so many Christmas festivities and other road race events jostling for attention is a serious achievement.

 
The race started at the Railway station and then took in a loop of the famous fields of Athenry where it turns left and begins it's return to the town, passing the soccer club, over the railway lines, and finishing under the medival arch in Athenry town for a fittingly atmospheric finish to the race. The route as it passes around the fields and outskirts of Athenry are wonderful country road running surroundings. Race HQ is in the Presentation College in Athenry. Post race showers, prize giving ceremony, and refreshments were provided in the College after the race.

  
We have a very extensive set of photographs from this year's event. The link to the full set of photographs on this Flickr photostream is here: <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/peterm7/albums/72157705013920945"">www.flickr.com/photos/peterm7/albums/72157705013920945</a>.

I've been here dozens of times, and I'm still seeing things for the first time.

Red Rock Canyon State Park features scenic desert cliffs, buttes and spectacular rock formations. The park is located where the southernmost tip of the Sierra Nevada converge with the El Paso Range. Each tributary canyon is unique, with dramatic shapes and vivid colors. 

Historically, the area was once home to the Kawaiisu Indians, who left petroglyphs in the El Paso mountains and other evidence of their inhabitation. The spectacular gash situated at the western edge of the El Paso mountain range was on the Native American trade route for thousands of years. During the early 1870s, the colorful rock formations in the park served as landmarks for 20-mule team freight wagons that stopped for water. About 1850, it was used by the footsore survivors of the famous Death Valley trek including members of the Arcane and Bennett families along with some of the Illinois Jayhawkers. The park now protects significant paleontology sites and the remains of 1890s-era mining operations, and has been the site for a number of movies.

After wet winters, the park's floral displays are stunning. The beauty of the desert, combined with the geologic features make this park a camper's favorite destination. Wildlife you may encounter includes roadrunners, hawks, lizards, mice and squirrels.","https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47956576006_44cd9b9a24_o.jpg","[{""name"":""Matthew Dillon"",""url"":null}]","by","wildflowers","jpeg","https://www.flickr.com/","2019-03-31","3000x2247"

Fota Island is host to Ireland's only wildlife park – as well as the historical Fota House and gardens and golf course owned by the &quot;Fota Island Golf Club and Resort&quot;. The island comprises two townlands both called Foaty: one each in the civil parishes of Clonmel (the western half of Great Island) and Carrigtohill (on the mainland).

Although Foaty is the spelling fixed in the nineteenth century by the Ordnance Survey of Ireland, Fota is now more common. The origin of the name is uncertain.

By rail, the island is served by Fota railway station, which opened on 1 July 1865.

Kildare, Ireland on Sunday 18th August 2019 at 10:10. The race is promoted by the St. Coca's AC club and this is a very successful second installment of the race. With over 600 participants there is a great deal of work and organisation required to stage a long distance race in the area between the Kilcock, Maynooth and Clane catchment areas. St. Coca's AC have established a fine reputation from their annual 5KM road race held every June. They are also well known for the lavish and plentiful after-race refreshment spreads they provide!

The race has grown and expanded on its first installment where there were 500 finishers. This year seen just over 600 finishers of the race.  

The weather was a mixed affair. Temperatures were warm and pleasant but there was a very strong westerly breeze. This has both a headwind and tailwind effect in the race, most notably making the Canal section at the end a little more difficult. There was a light shower of rain during the race. 
 

The race starts near Scoil Ui Riada on the Kilcock to Clane road. The route heads south-easterly along the first 1.5 miles of the Kilcock AC 5KM road race route. The route turns right here at Laragh and heads towards the townlands of Clonfirth, Baltracey and Balraheen. The half way point is at the well known Ladychapel Church crossroads between the L1010 and the Maynooth-Rathcoffey R408 road. Proceeding northwards toward Maynooth the race takes a left at the Crinstown Cross Roads to mark the turn back westerly towards Kilcock. Just after mile 7 the race crosses the M4/M6 Kilcock/Maynooth motorway bypass. This crossing and the next canal bridge are the only real 'hills' on the course. The last two miles turn westward toward Kilcock along the Royal Canal Greenway. The race enters the Greenway at Jackson's Bridge and proceeds along the bank of the Canal under Bailey's Bridge, across Chamber's Bridge and finishing at The Harbour in Kilcock opposite Lidl and the former Dermot Kelly's Garage. Water stations are provided at mile 3 and mile 6. Overall, the route is fast, fair and very suitable to fast road racing and competitive times. 

Our full set of photographs from today's race are available here on Flickr at the following album: <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/peterm7/albums/72157710376217787"">www.flickr.com/photos/peterm7/albums/72157710376217787</a>

One of the interesting features of the race is the start time of 10:10 in the morning. The significance of the 10s are as follows: it is a 10 mile race, it is 10 weeks exactly from the Dublin City Marathon in October 2019, and the course is a great opportunity for runners of all abilities to gain that illusive PB or season best.

The North Carolina State Fair brought nearly one million people through its gates in 2018, and officials with the Governor’s Highway Safety Program (GHSP) are urging drivers to remain alert as increased traffic often translates into increased roadway incidents. “The more people you have converging on one event, could mean more potential for pedestrian-vehicle collisions, drunk driving incidents, crashes that result in injuries and fatalities unfortunately,” said GHSP Director Mark Ezzell. Not only will the fair bring in large crowds of travelers from across the county, state and southeast to the State Fairgrounds over its 11 days but adding to the crowds and traffic are several concert and sporting events over the same time at the nearby PNC Arena. “Each traveler needs to know that there will may be an impaired, unbelted, distracted or inexperienced driver traveling near them at some point and they must stay vigilant,” Ezzell continued. GHSP staff will be on-hand at the State Fair sponsoring the Safety City exhibit: a virtual highway safety community that seeks to decrease roadway injuries and fatalities by educating attendees on safe driving behaviors. Some of the ‘Safety City’ national, state and local agencies include: Mothers Against Drunk Driving Safe Kids NC Watch for Me NC BeRailSafe NC and NC Operation Lifesaver Choices For Chase Operation Lifesaver DHHS Forensic Tests For Alcohol Branch Alcohol Law Enforcement and Alcohol Beverage Control Bike Safe NC NC Moves And many more The exhibit is open during the duration of the fair, Oct. 17 through Oct. 27 and is located behind the Kerr Scott Building on the fairgrounds along Blue Ridge Road in Raleigh. If you can’t make it to Safety City, GHSP officials pass on these safety tips, simple things that can save your life or the life of someone around you: #1 Buckle up. Wearing your seatbelt decreases your chances of dying in a crash by almost half. #2 Drive sober. Use a ride sharing app, take public transportation (bus and or train to and from the fair), call a friend; speak up if someone is under the influence and planning to get behind the wheel! #3 Slow Down. Pay Attention. Distracted driving and speeding claim lives every day and are preventable behaviors. While traveling to and from the fair and other area events, show us that you are a safe driver! Snap a photo of yourself and your passengers safely secured and tag @NC_GHSP on Instagram, Twitter and @NCGHSP on Facebook. Use hashtags #SafetyCity and or #NCGHSP and we’ll “Like” your picture! GHSP funds efforts to reduce traffic crashes in North Carolina and promotes highway safety awareness through a variety of grants and safe-driving initiatives like Click It or Ticket, Booze It &amp; Lose It, BikeSafe NC, Watch For Me NC and Speed a Little. Lose a Lot.

"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Balaenoptera_musculus_(blue_whale)_1_(31068434305).jpg","Balaenoptera musculus (blue whale) 1 (31068434305).jpg","Balaenoptera musculus (Linnaeus, 1758) - blue whale skeleton (real). (public display, North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, Rayleigh, North Carolina, USA) Mammals are the dominant group of terrestrial vertebrates on Earth today. The group is defined based on a combination of features: endothermic (= warm-blooded), air-breathing, body hair, mother's milk, four-chambered heart, large brain-to-body mass ratio, two teeth generations, differentiated dentition, and a single lower jawbone. Almost all modern mammals have live birth - exceptions are the duck-billed platypus and the echidna, both of which lay eggs. Mammals first appear in the Triassic fossil record - they evolved from the therapsids (mammal-like reptiles). Mammals were mostly small and a minor component of terrestrial ecosystems during the Mesozoic. After the Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction at 65 million years ago, the mammals underwent a significant adaptive radiation - most modern mammal groups first appeared during this radiation in the early Cenozoic (Paleocene and Eocene). Three groups of mammals exist in the Holocene - placentals, marsupials, and monotremes. Other groups, now extinct, were present during the Mesozoic. Whales are members of Order Cetacea, which includes the dolphins and porpoises. Cetaceans have intermediate- to very large-sized bodies that are streamlined (cigar-shaped) and have a thick blubber layer for heat insulation purposes. They are evolutionarily derived from terrestrial mammals that had four legs. The former front legs are now flippers. The hind legs are highly reduced and non-functional in whales. The skull is elongated, with one or two blowholes atop the head. The tail is horizontally-oriented, unlike the vertically-oriented caudal fin (""tail"") of a fish. Vertical movement of a whale's tail provides propulsion. Whale bodies have a soft outer skin layer with almost no hair - this improves water flow around the body. Whales are famous for being deep and long divers. Sperm whales can dive to over 9,200 feet deep. Northern bottlenose whales can hold their breath for over two hours. Unlike humans, whales have evolved mechanisms for coping with diving diseases such as nitrogen narcosis and decompression sickness. Cetaceans are subdivided into two groups - the odontocete whales and the mysticete whales. The odontocetes are the toothed whales and include the sperm whale, killer whale, dolphins, and porpoises. Mysticete whales are the baleen whales - they include the blue whale, finback whale, humpback whale, gray whale, right whale, minke whale, sei whale, etc. Baleen whales have much larger bodies than toothed whales and have two blowholes atop the head. They eat low on the food pyramid - their dominant food is krill, which is an abundant, small crustacean (Animalia, Arthropoda, Crustacea). Baleen whales usually feed near the surface. Instead of having teeth, these animals have baleen - parallel rows of keratin plates hanging down from the upper jaw. Baleen is used to concentrate small prey and separate them from seawater. Individual baleen plates can be up to 14 feet long. The blue whale is the largest animal on Earth - it is a baleen whale. This organism is more massive than even the largest dinosaur. The heaviest sauropod dinosaur was about 150 tons. The heaviest known blue whale was about 200 tons. Blue whale skeletons are rarely on display. The example shown above is in North Carolina's natural history museum in Rayleigh. From museum signage: ""Named for its motley blue-gray color, the blue whale is known for its enormous size. At over 100 feet and weighing as much as 160 tons, it is the largest mammal ever to live on Earth. It has a long, broad head with two blowholes and long, slender flippers. Because diatoms sometimes make its underside yellow, the blue whale is nicknamed ""Sulfur Bottom"". How do you feed a blue whale? With at least two tons of tiny shrimp, called krill, every day. Blue whales swim near the surface and lunge after schools of prey. As they take in huge volumes of water, the grooves that line their throats expand like giant balloons. When they push the water out through the baleen, a filtering system, the krill are trapped. The whales use their tongues to lick the krill from the baleen. Why is the skull of this whale darker than the rest of its skeleton? The bones of whales contain oil, most of which is removed when the bones are cleaned. The skull contains a lot more oil than the smaller bones and will continue to seep for many years. Blue whale females remain pregnant for about a year. At birth, calves are 25 feet long, weigh more than two tons, and grow at the rate of 200-250 pounds a day. Blue whales migrate seasonally between their tropical or temperate breeding grounds and their polar feeding grounds worldwide. They commonly stay far from shore, making it difficult to track their migrations or study behavior. In the early 1900s, whalers found great profit in whale oil. Because blue whales could produce about six times more oil than smaller species, they were hunted nearly to extinction. Blue whales are now completely protected by international agreement and their numbers are increasing. Lamp oil and other products once made from whale oili are now made from vegetables and petroleum.

It is a typical manuscript for edification, in German, as they were customarily used and written at the end of the Middle Ages for private devotion, especially in women’s convents and in lay communities. Margret Zschampi donated the manuscript to the Carthusian monastery of Basel, where it became part of the library for lay brothers. As part of this Carthusian library, the devotional book reached the university library of Basel in 1590.

"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bazalgette_Lancaster_FM-159_(50999397975).jpg","Bazalgette Lancaster FM-159 (50999397975).jpg","From the museum website: Bazalgette Lancaster FM-159 Lancaster FM159 is a lucky Lancaster. One of 7374 built to help vanquish the Nazis, it was fortunate to have arrived for battle after the war in Europe ended, thus avoiding the flak and fighters that destroyed 3932 of its cohorts. Saved from the scrap yard, the aircraft enjoyed a fulfilling career with the Royal Canadian Air Force, travelling widely from bases on both coasts to play a valuable role during the Cold War. Replaced by a more modern aircraft, FM159 again escaped the scrap yard to become a town’s landmark, watching the highway traffic pass by for thirty-one years. Finally, FM159 found itself dedicated to a Canadian war hero and the centrepiece of a museum telling the story of those who served in aircraft like it during the Second World War. Lancaster Bombers – Made In Canada During the early years of the Second World War, the British and their Allies were building as many aircraft as possible. In a surprisingly short time, thousands of aircraft of several types, including four-engined Lancaster Bombers, were being produced in Canada. For a country still largely agrarian and just recovering from a decade of depression, the challenge that was met was immense. Eventually Lancaster production reached the level of one aircraft per day and the project employed ten thousand people. A total of 430 were built and 105 were lost in action. Too Late For The War Strangely, as the Canadian-built Lancasters that had operated during the war were returning home, newly built aircraft such as FM159 were being flown to England, even though the war in Europe had ended. After spending four months in England, FM159 returned to Canada, arriving safely at Yarmouth, Nova Scotia to join others in temporary storage. However there was concern that the damp, salty climate of the Maritimes was beginning to cause corrosion and it was decided to fly hundreds of the bombers to a drier climate. Residents of western Canada must have been shocked to hear the roar of the huge warplanes as they travelled across the prairies. The aircrew aboard knew the horror of war, but they had beaten the odds and survived and were understandably elated. As they crossed the prairies and before landing their aircraft for the last time, they buzzed towns and farms at extremely low level, frightening both residents and livestock. Numerous Lancasters, including FM159, landed at the former training base at Pearce, Alberta, northeast of Fort Macleod. Many were sold to farmers. A Lanc could be purchased for a few hundred dollars and its parts put to many uses on the farm. To begin with there was lots of oil and hydraulic cylinders that could be adapted to various uses around the farm. The aircraft also provided a seemingly endless supply of wire, metal tubes, and sheet aluminum. Some of the more novel ideas were placing Lancaster tail wheels on threshing machines, using crew door ladders for checking the level in grain bins, placing bomb-bay doors as borders of flower gardens, using propeller spinners as plant pots, and incorporating escape hatches (with windows) into the construction of outhouses. Parked next to a slough with cows grazing below her port wing, this Lancaster has arrived at it’s new home. Being a low-time Lancaster, FM159 was saved from the fate of becoming a farmer’s hardware store, On March 18, 1946, it made a short hop to the former training base at Fort Macleod, and was placed in storage. RCAF Service At Greenwood FM159 was recalled for duty as a result of the international situation in the early 1950’s. Following the increase in tension between East and West, the RCAF ordered the modification of seventy Lancasters to become maritime reconnaissance aircraft and play an anti-submarine role. The modifications included upgraded electronics and auxiliary fuel tanks fitted in the bomb bay. A silver paint scheme completed the conversion and FM159 emerged as a modern maritime reconnaissance aircraft. From October, 1953 until early 1955 it served with No. 103 Search and Rescue Unit based at Greenwood, Nova Scotia. Then there were more modifications including the installation of a new radar system that enabled a snorkelling submarine to be detected at a distance of 20 nautical miles and FM159 was transferred to the west coast to begin service with No. 407 Squadron. The threat posed by Soviet submarines in Canada’s Pacific waters was being countered by Lancasters based at Comox on Vancouver Island. As well as maritime reconnaissance, the squadron was also tasked with search and rescue and other duties. No. 407 Squadron – The Comox Years Almost immediately, FM159 was off on what was one of its most exciting adventures. Flying over Canada’s high Arctic, an ice observer charted the colours, cracks, leads, and movement of the sea ice so that the Dew Line radar sites could be re-supplied. The flights were lengthy, some as long as ten hours. FM159’s longest flight concluded with an unscheduled visit to the northernmost point in Canada, Alert, on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island just 490 miles from the north pole. While returning from a long patrol to their base at Resolute Bay on Cornwallis Island, Captain Harry Addison received word that the airfield was experiencing a “white out.” He was advised to fly to Thule, Greenland. Then about half an hour out of Thule, Harry was told that they were experiencing zero visibility. He then asked for another alternate and was advised that the weather at Alert was forecasted to improve. But Alert only came on the radio every four hours so they didn’t know for sure. It was a 500 mile flight and the navigator’s maps didn’t go that far north. According to Harry Addison, “Freddy Pineau, the flight engineer, was frantically doing all sorts of engine configurations to increase our flying time as we were getting critically low on fuel. About forty miles out of Alert they came on with their regularly scheduled weather broadcast and we were relieved to hear that Alert was practically clear. Never having landed a Lancaster with so little fuel on board, we must have floated two thirds of the runway before touching down. After a few “Hail Mary’s” the pale faces returned to colour and, as we turned off the runway, number four engine died from lack of fuel. We had landed after a flying time of 12 hours 25 minutes. Needless to say we were all relieved to be on the ground.” FM159 had another close call in 1956 when an engine exploded and burned one foggy night over the Pacific. Then, while returning to base, all electrics and navigation was lost. Pilot Bert Clark recalled, “It’s a strange feeling to be moving along at 180 knots into a black void not knowing where you are.” Eventually they followed another aircraft home, passing through the Straits of Juan de Fuca at 300 feet without being able to see the lights of Vancouver. During 1956, FM159 participated in an exercise designed to test the capability of Canadian and American interceptor squadrons. After leaving Comox and travelling north into the interior of BC, pilot Fred Burton dropped down into the valleys of the Rockies to avoid detection by radar. He recalled, “The Canadians did catch us and we were jumped by CF-100’s. We continued on our southerly track and crossed into Washington State with no further interception. We then climbed to about 20,000 feet and began our simulated bomb run over the city of Spokane. We made three passes before a USAF F86 came up to see who we were!” Later that year, FM159 searched for a Trans Canada Airlines North Star that went down after leaving Vancouver with sixty people aboard included many players from the western all-star football team. FM159 travelled widely during those years including trips to Alaska and to the British Isles to take part in anti-submarine exercises. Flight engineer Duke Dawe recalled a problem while flying near London. “The crystals for the radio were kept in a nice metal box with the frequencies labeled next to them. All went well on the first crystal change, but then the radio operator opened the box upside down, and all the crystals fell to the floor. What a mess! Needless to say we flew right through London control without talking to anyone. They must have had to divert all the traffic away form us.” The Lancaster era at Comox drew to a close in 1958 and it was with some nostalgia that F/L Brooks and flight engineer Duke Dawe left Comox, flew across the mountains, and parked FM159 at RCAF Station Calgary. The aircraft had acquired a total of 2068 hours since its overhaul in 1953. Duke recalled that leaving Lanc159 was a “rather moving experience.” He had flown in the aircraft 62 times, accumulating a total of 224.5 hours and he, “always had a very great feeling for her.” Later a civilian crew flew the aircraft to the former BCATP base southwest of Vulcan where its engines and props were removed and the aircraft was to be scrapped. A Lanc For Nanton But luck was with FM159. In 1960, George White of Nanton had the idea of acquiring an aircraft as a war memorial and tourist attraction for his town. After hearing that FM159 was to be scrapped he, together with Howie Armstrong and Fred Garratt, purchased the bomber for $513. George recalled that they realized that the Lancaster’s main wheels were too far apart to permit travelling along the roads. So the Nanton volunteers waited until the crops were all harvested, put the tail wheel in the back of a truck, and towed the bomber backwards across the fields. Two fencing crews were organized, one to take down the barbed wire fences ahead of the aircraft and a second to put them back up again. One of the more interesting challenges was easing the aircraft down the banks of the Little Bow River, through the ford, and up the other side. Late in the day FM159 passed between the south end of Connemara Lake and Mosquito Creek and reached the CPR tracks where the strange procession stopped for the night. Early the following morning the aircraft was pulled across the tracks and up onto Highway No. 2. It was smooth sailing from there and triumphantly, but likely somewhat uncomfortably, Lancaster bomber FM159 entered the Town of Nanton and was parked by the side of the highway. The Nanton Lancaster When FM159 arrived in Nanton it was complete and could have flown had the engines and propellers not been removed. Two years later it was a gutted shell, thieves having removed the instruments and interior equipment and vandals having broken the cockpit, turrets, and bomb-aimers perspex, and torn the fabric of the control surfaces. The aircraft was on the edge of town at the time and despite efforts by Fred Garratt and others, there was no stopping the vandalism. In 1962 volunteers began to put FM159 back on the road to recovery from its sorry state. Engines and propellers were purchased and installed. The aircraft was placed on steel mounts, its tail high in the air to limit access. Fortunately those in charge took the time to ensure that the aircraft would not be damaged. Steel mounts were fabricated and the aircraft continued to rest on its landing gear. Although mounted on steel supports and with its new propellers, FM159 appears very uncared for with broken perspex and bomb doors hanging open. [ courtesy John Nelson ] Harry Dwelle fabricated aluminum “windows” to cover the broken perspex. This was most important as bird droppings cause rapid corrosion in an aluminium airplane. Ray McMahon, together with his family and friends, repaired the exterior as much as possible and painted the aircraft. The trio that purchased FM159 then donated the aircraft to the Town. Over the following twenty years volunteers and service clubs did what they could to keep FM159 looking its best as millions of people drove by on Highway No. 2 and the “Nanton Bomber” became a symbol for the Town. Ray McMahon in the late 1960’s. During the 1980’s interest from outside Nanton was being shown. Offers to acquire the aircraft had been received from several individuals and even from her previous owners at Comox. However the Town rejected these advances and in 1985 looked again to George White for leadership, asking him to see if he could form an organization to, “take care of the bomber.” The Nanton Lancaster Society George wrote an article in the Nanton News asking if anyone was interested in helping. He was overwhelmed with the response and the Nanton Lancaster Society was formed. At this time no one had been in the aircraft for twenty-five years and virtually no one in Nanton knew anything about Lancasters in general, or FM159 in particular. But soon related artifacts were on display and Lancaster T-shirts and caps were for sale in the local tourist information booth. The Society had also made the decision that the best way to, “take care of the bomber” was to restore it to its wartime configuration as the centrepiece of an air museum -a rather ambitious undertaking for a community of fewer than 2000 people. “Open Bomber Days” were held featuring tours through FM159. These were most successful with long lines forming at the ladder leading to the cockpit. The aircraft’s role in the education of future generations had begun. In 1991, through the co-operation of the three levels of government, Legion Branches, corporations, and thousands of individuals, a museum building was completed. On a bright Saturday morning, FM159 was rolling again, this time towed by a farm tractor into her new home. FM159 is dedicated to the memory of Ian Bazalgette, a Lancaster pilot who was awarded the Commonwealth’s highest award for valour, the only Albertan to be so recognized during WW II. Ian was born in Calgary, educated in Britain, and joined the Royal Air Force. After completing a tour of operations, “Baz,” as he became known as, volunteered for additional service with the Pathfinder Force. Bazalgette’s Lancaster was hit by flak while approaching a V-1 Rocket site. Both starboard engines were knocked out and fires started. As the Master Bomber and Deputy Master Bomber were out of action it was up to Baz to mark the target for the remainder of the force. This he did but then the aircraft went into a violent dive. He regained control but soon the fire spread and a third engine stopped running. He ordered four of his crew to parachute but chose to remain on board in an attempt to save the others who were injured and could not jump. Baz managed to land the aircraft but it exploded and all aboard were killed. The surviving crew members evaded enemy soldiers and made their way to the allied forces. The story was told and the Victoria Cross awarded. The citation reads that, “His courage and devotion to duty were beyond praise.” Larry Melling served with Ian. He recalls being impressed by him on his first day at the squadron when he walked into the Flight Office, “He had a tremendous sparkle in his eye is the best way to describe it. He stood out amongst the people who were there. He was an inviting sort of a person, a person that you wouldn’t hesitate to approach. He was always the first to volunteer for a job, no matter what sort of job it might be.” A Dedication Ceremony was held in 1990. Mrs. Ethel Broderick, Ian’s sister, unveiled a plaque and the markings of the Bazalgette aircraft (F2-T) were unveiled by two of Baz’s crewmembers, Chuck Godfrey and George Turner. FM159’s friends from No. 407 Squadron were represented on this special day as well. The squadron’s c/o, Lt. Col. Terry Chester, spoke at the ceremonies and a squadron Aurora performed a flypast together with a CF-5 jet. The Restoration of FM159 – One Piece at a Time Early in the history of the Nanton Lancaster Society a decision was made to restore FM159 to its wartime configuration as a memorial to those who served with Bomber Command. The aircraft has been inspected by engineers and found to be in very sound condition. With this in mind, restoration has proceeded with the goal of having a fully restored, static display aircraft that is capable of engine run-ups. Society members have scoured southern Alberta, visiting the barns and junk piles of farms whose owners had purchased Lancasters after the war. This has resulted in an extensive collection of parts that are used in the restoration of the aircraft and for trading with other museums. The first major restoration project involved the pilot’s instrument panel. Jon Spinks acquired the instruments in England and by late 1987 had completed the beautifully restored panel. Extensive work has since been done to restore the aircraft’s mid-upper and rear gun turrets. Following three years of work, the rear turret was made fully operational. The perspex in the cockpit canopy and bomb aimer’s position has been replaced as has that in the gun turrets. After suffering from water damage over the years, the navigator/wireless operator’s table was removed and rebuilt. Over a twelve-year period that began in 2003 the Lancaster’s four Merlin engines were restored to runnable and the aircraft became taxiable. The hydraulic system was restored so that bomb-doors can be opened and closed and flaps deployed. Much restoration work has been done on the interior as well including installation of the ammunition tracks to the rear gun turret and installation of all the equipment at the wireless operator, navigator, flight engineer, and bomb-aimer’s positions. It’s important that all this has been done by volunteers working on Tuesday evenings. Restoring a World War II bomber is a huge undertaking, particularly when the museum itself has been under constant development. Numerous other aircraft have been acquired and restoration projects completed during the time that the Lancaster has been under restoration. Restoring a World War II bomber is a huge undertaking, particularly when the museum itself has been under constant development. Numerous other aircraft have been acquired and restoration projects completed. Major building and expansion projects are frequently underway. FM159 Today FM159 now enjoys a fulfilling role as the centre-piece of the Bomber Command Museum of Canada (formerly the Nanton Lancaster Society Air Museum). The museum features a dozen other aircraft as well as artifacts, aviaition art, and interpretive displays that tell the story of Bomber Command and Canada’s contribution to the air war. Hundreds of thousands of people have visited and all have left knowing more of the sacrifices that were made by the aircrew of Bomber Command. FM159 remains the only Lancaster in the world that welcomes supervised visitors to its interior. During one of the “Open Bomber Days,” two Lancaster veterans who had not seen each other since WW II met and embraced inside the aircraft. Over the years FM159 has witnessed countless other memorable moments as aircrew have relived their memories. These include both the horrors they went through as well as happier times that forged lifetime bonds with their fellow crewmembers. Some Bomber Command veterans freely tell of their experiences as they visit, others quietly keep their memories to themselves. Some are brought to tears and others have just walked around the aircraft, unable to bring themselves to step inside. Ground crew, women who served with the RCAF, and others who played important roles with Bomber Command have toured the museum. Men and women who worked for Victory Aircraft have visited FM159, some pointing to a particular part and saying, “I built that,” or “I riveted those pieces together.” Former aircrew who flew aboard FM159 during her postwar service are regular visitors and recall their valuable service during the Cold War. Each year classes of school children sit under her wing to be told what freedom means and the role of Canada’s Airforce in the past and today. Air Cadet Squadrons and veterans’ and seniors’ organizations visit regularly as well. Dozens of special events have been held under FM159’s wings. The bomber hears moving speeches of Remembrance and presides over solemn ceremonies. Guests seated on her wing have heard the stirring RAF Marchpast during band concerts, a choir has sung, “Coming in on a Wing and a Prayer” from her cockpit, and a couple was married on the starboard wing. But most importantly, the aircraft has been host to thousands of aircrew and their families as they visit the museum to honour, to learn, and to remember. In many cases the families have heard, for the first time, of a father’s or grandfather’s role in Bomber Command. World War II touched the lives of all Canadian families and the Royal Canadian Air Force will always be a significant part of many family histories. Each year thousands of visitors come to the museum knowing that the Lancaster played a crucial role in the life of a parent, grandparent, uncle or aunt. FM159 and its museum tell their stories well. Visitors are often in awe of both the aircraft and those who served. They leave the museum with increased appreciation of the successes and sacrifices associated with Bomber Command.

It was painted in the manner of the Byzantine provincial school of the first quarter of the 15th century. Painted ornaments and multi-figure compositions with secular themes were for the most part a eulogy for the Grand Duke of Lithuania Vytautas the Great and his courtiers.

The building was the successor to two previous capitol buildings, constructed in 1853 and 1883, which stood closer to Downtown Saint Paul, and featured brick exteriors with stone trim.  The third capitol building, clad in marble sourced from Georgia, features the second-largest self-supported marble dome in the world, only being surpassed by its primary inspiration, the dome of St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, Italy.  A large gold Quadriga, known as “Progress of the State”, stands below the dome, above the building’s front entrance.  The building has large outdoor stairways to the south, east, and west, leading up to entrances, with passageways underneath these stairways featuring tiled vaults.  Two smaller domes sit atop each of the building’s symmetrical wings, over the Senate Chamber and Supreme Court Chamber, with a large half-dome in the rear over the House of Representatives Chamber.  The interior of the building is beautifully decorated with lots of ornate trim and symbolic motifs, including painted ceilings, stone floors, wood paneled walls, and gilded trim.  As originally built, the capitol was surrounded by a dense, mixed-use urban neighborhood, which was cleared over the following decades to enlarge the park-like grounds around the building, attaining its present size and form by the mid-1950s, though leaving the capitol quite detached from the surrounding city.  The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, and underwent massive restoration efforts both in the 1970s, and between 2013 and 2017.","https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51670982438_7af687b032_o.jpg","[{""name"":""Warren LeMay"",""url"":null}]","by-sa","historic building","jpeg","https://www.flickr.com/","2021-09-17","3024x4032"

Located at the crest of the Going-to-the-Sun Road at Logan Pass, the visitor center features a roofline that follows the hillside underneath, with a long covered outdoor stairway connecting the exhibit hall and gift shop at the top with a restroom and service building below.

Various dynasties between the c. 4th century BCE to about the c. 8th-century CE ruled it (the Kalinga style continued between the 9th and 13th-centuries). Almost all of these were Hindu dynasties and they built some distinctive, spectacular temples as well patronized Buddhist and Jain monuments. There more lasting impact is found in Southeast Asia, through trade and migration of religious ideas. In parts of SE Asia, there influence was so extensive, that Indians were broadly called ""klings"" no matter which part of India they came from. Saripalli village of Vizianagaram district is about 10 kilometers northeast of Vizianagaram city. It is one of about twelve notable sites in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha area known for surviving or ruined Kalinga temples. The above temple and artwork is found in Saripalli. This Shiva temple illustrates 9th-century Nagara architecture in the Kalinga Rekha Deul style (Odisha). It has a square plan, a five bhumis shikhara, and follows the Sanskrit texts on vastu and silpa sastra. Notable reliefs here include Shiva, Mahisasuramardini, Kartikeya, Ganesha and Ekapdamurti – special to Kalinga temples. Ekapdamurti is Siva doing yoga standing on one leg. There are additional reliefs found in Odiya temples such as amorous couples, Nagas, Naginis, Nandi, and different forms of Shiva. The temple is likely the surviving structure of a larger complex that was here.","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Dibbesvara_temple%2C_Kalinga-style%2C_Saripalli_Andhra_Pradesh_26.jpg/450px-Dibbesvara_temple%2C_Kalinga-style%2C_Saripalli_Andhra_Pradesh_26.jpg?20210926211443","[{""name"":""Ms Sarah Welch"",""url"":""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Ms_Sarah_Welch""}]","Creative Commons Zero, Public Domain Dedication","ancient temples","jpeg","https://commons.wikimedia.org/","2021-09-26","3,120 × 4,160 "

Many of the social and cultural proposals in this plan were ignored by the Dublin local authorities, and contrary to planners' suggestions, Tallaght and the other ""new towns"" were not provided with adequate facilities. Characterised by the same problems associated with poorly planned fringe areas of many European cities, during the 1970s and 1980s Tallaght became synonymous with suburban mismanagement. While it was absorbed into the larger suburban area of Dublin (including becoming the postal district Dublin 24 in the late 1980s), Tallaght has developed a distinctive identity, arising largely from its rapid growth during recent decades, and now has a thriving local arts, cultural, sports, and economic outlook. Tallaght's Civic Square contains the seat of the local authority, County Hall, a newly renovated and well-equipped library facility, a theatre building and a ""cutting edge"" 4-storey arts centre named RUA RED (which opened on 5 February 2009). Along with other local libraries and arts groups, it also has another theatre building, and a homegrown youth theatre company. It is also the home to the Tallaght Swim Team, Tallaght Rugby Club , the National Basketball Arena, Shamrock Rovers F.C., and several notable martial arts schools and Gaelic Athletic Association clubs.","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Tallaght_-_Chinese_%26_Thai_Restaurant_-_Wei_Kee_%285209420405%29.jpg/800px-Tallaght_-_Chinese_%26_Thai_Restaurant_-_Wei_Kee_%285209420405%29.jpg?20220221161013","[{""name"":""SeichanGant"",""url"":""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:SeichanGant""}]","Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic","martial arts","jpeg","https://commons.wikimedia.org/","2022-02-21","3,264 × 1,840 "

It was opened in 1978 by Brian Masterson who is a company director and head engineer. It was originally used to record traditional Irish music until U2 came along and began to record there. Prior to this, Irish rock bands such as Thin Lizzy or The Boomtown Rats carried out their recordings outside Ireland. It is now boarded up, with the actual studios having moved elsewhere. Nevertheless, the studios are still a popular cult symbol and are regularly visited by tourists, particularly those originally from the United States. Criticism has been expressed amongst local activists at proposed plans to turn the old building into a six-storey office block. Pulse Recording College recently took ownership of the studios. The college has previously sent students to work at Windmill Lane straight after graduation and these students have collaborated with 50 Cent, Bryan Adams, Moya Brennan, Donovan, Jon Bon Jovi and New Order. Windmill Lane Studios is globally recognised for its connection to internationally recognised artists of Irish extraction such as U2, Sinéad O'Connor, Eleanor McEvoy, The Corrs, and Clannad, whilst Van Morrison acquired it for his own personal use in 2006. Juniper, a band which later became Bell X1 and Damien Rice, recorded some of their musical material on location at the studios during their brief existence in the 1990s. The Clannad song, ""Theme from Harry's Game"", which went on to chart in the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom, as well as in the band's native Ireland, was originally recorded at Windmill Lane Studios. International artists have also made use of Windmill Lane Studios; these include the Rolling Stones, Kate Bush, Kylie Minogue, R.E.M., Elvis Costello, The Waterboys and The Spice Girls. Albums to have been fully or partially recorded at Windmill Lane Studios include Boy, War and The Joshua Tree by U2, Back on Top, Magic Time and Pay the Devil by Van Morrison, Hounds of Love by Kate Bush, Fisherman's Blues by The Waterboys, and Spike by Elvis Costello. Renowned producers such as Steve Lillywhite, Brian Eno, Daniel Lanois, Stephen Street, Geoff Emerick, Nellee Hooper, Trevor Horn, Flood and Don Was have made extensive use of the facilities at Windmill Lane Studios. The soundtracks to several films have been recorded at Windmill Lane Studios. These include the soundtracks to films such as A Room with a View, The Remains of the Day, The Mask and The Tailor of Panama, as well as The Grifters, My Left Foot and A River Runs Through It. Orchestras would regularly record their music there as it is one of the larger locations in Ireland to do this. Windmill Lane Studios have been recommended as a tourist attraction by publications such as The New York Times. Many people are attracted by the significant amounts of graffiti left as a tribute to acts such as U2 and some even add to it themselves when they visit the site.","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Wide_Angle_Views_Of_Dublin_Street_Art_%283939559471%29.jpg/800px-Wide_Angle_Views_Of_Dublin_Street_Art_%283939559471%29.jpg?20220221022002","[{""name"":""SeichanGant"",""url"":""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:SeichanGant""}]","Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic","traditional mask","jpeg","https://commons.wikimedia.org/","2022-02-21","5,616 × 3,744 "

"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Old_Fort_Erie,_Fort_Erie,_Ontario_(29871646882).jpg","Old Fort Erie, Fort Erie, Ontario (29871646882).jpg","Old Fort Erie, also known as Fort Erie, or the Fort Erie National Historic Site of Canada, was the first British fort to be constructed as part of a network developed after the Seven Years' War (often referred to as the French and Indian War in the United States) was concluded by the Treaty of Paris (1763) at which time all of New France had been ceded to Great Britain. It is located on the southern edge of the Town of Fort Erie, Ontario, directly across the Niagara River from Buffalo, New York. The fort and surrounding battlefield are owned and operated by the Niagara Parks Commission, a self-funded agency of the Ontario provincial government. The British established control by occupying the French forts and by constructing a line of communications along the Niagara River and Upper Great Lakes. The original fort, built in 1764, was located on the Niagara River's edge below the present fort. It served as a supply depot and a port for ships transporting merchandise, troops and passengers via Lake Erie to the Upper Great Lakes. In 1795, the fort consisted of some wooden blockhouses surrounded by a wooden palisade (dropped from the plan was a magazine, officer's quarters, storehouses and guard house). Provisions were stored inside the fort, and just outside was a large wooden magazine (original plans was to have it built inside the fort) as well as houses for workmen. The fort was damaged by winter storms and in 1803, plans were made for a new fort on the higher ground behind the original. It was larger and made of flintstone but was not quite finished at the start of the War of 1812. The fort first saw action as a supply base for British troops, United Empire Loyalists Rangers and Iroquois Warriors during the American Revolution. The little fort at the water's edge suffered considerable damage due to continuous winter storms. In 1803, planning was authorized for a new Fort Erie on the heights behind the original post. The new fort was made more formidable being constructed of the Onondaga Flintstone that was readily available in the area. Fort Erie was the site of the bloodiest battlefield in the history of Canada. This new fort was unfinished when the United States declared war on June 18, 1812. Part of the garrison of Fort Erie fought at the Battle of Frenchman's Creek against an American attack in November 1812. In 1813, Fort Erie was held for a period by U.S. forces and then abandoned on June 9, 1813. The fort had been partially dismantled by the small garrison of British troops and Canadian Militia as they withdrew. British reoccupation followed American withdrawal from the area in December 1813. The British attempted to rebuild the fort. On July 3, 1814 another American force landed nearby and again captured Fort Erie. The U.S. Army used the fort as a supply base and expanded its size. At the end of July, after the Battles of Chippewa and Lundy's Lane, the American army withdrew to Fort Erie and were besieged by the British. In the early hours of August 15, 1814, the British launched a four-pronged attack against the fortifications. A well-prepared American defence and an explosion in the North East Bastion destroyed the British chance for success with the loss of over 1,000 of their men. An American sortie on September 17 captured two of the British batteries and the American troops were able to spike the guns in one of them before being driven back to the fort. Brevet Lieutenant Colonel Eleazer D. Wood was killed leading this sortie. Shortly afterward, the British lifted the siege and retired to positions to the north at Chippawa. After an unsuccessful American attack at Cook's Mills, west of Chippawa, news reached the American forces that the eastern seaboard of the U.S. was under attack. On November 5, 1814, with winter approaching, the Americans destroyed the fort and withdrew to Buffalo. The Treaty of Ghent was signed December 24, 1814, ending the War of 1812. Fearing further American attacks, the British continued to occupy the ruined fort until 1823. Some of the stones from the fort were then incorporated into the construction of St. Paul's Anglican Church in 1824, which stands today (rebuilt after fire and explosion in 1892[4]) on the Niagara Parkway 3 km (1.9 mi) north of the fort. The town of Fort Erie began to grow north of the fortifications when a rail terminus and station were constructed. The Fenians, (Irish-American veterans of the American Civil War demanding independence from Britain for Ireland), mounted several raids on Upper Canada. One was quite large, at Fort Erie on 1 June 1866 after crossing the Niagara River with a thousand men, or 1500 men, depending on the source of the report.[5] The Fenians occupied the town and demanded food and horses. The only payment they were able to offer was Fenian bonds; these were not acceptable to the citizens. The Fenians then cut the telegraph wires and tore up some railway tracks. Afterwards, they marched to Chippewa and the next day to Ridgeway where they fought the Battle of Ridgeway, a series of skirmishes with the Canadian militia. The Fenians then returned to Fort Erie where they defeated a small force of the Canadian militia. Unable to get reinforcements from across the river which was guarded by the Americans, and worried about the large force of British and militia that was approaching, the Fenian commander decided to retreat to the U.S. Some of his troops deserted. Approximately 850 surrendered to forces of the American navy. This was the last notable Fenian raid on Upper Canada. The fort laid vacant with old parts of the barracks, walls and mill still standing and eventually settled by military pensioners and other settlers until it was sold to the Niagara Parks Commission in 1901. The reconstruction of the fort was started in 1937 (featuring only the walls and two barracks). The reconstruction was jointly sponsored by the Provincial and Federal governments and the Niagara Parks Commission. The fort was restored to the 1812-1814 period and officially reopened on July 1, 1939. During the restoration, a mass grave of 150 British and 3 American soldiers was uncovered and currently lies beneath a monument which was originally erected in the fort's ruins in 1904. The Parkway starts at Fort Erie and continues 56 km (35 mi) north to Lake Ontario. Sir Winston Churchill was quoted saying that the parkway was ""the prettiest Sunday drive in the world."" Each year, during the second weekend of August, hundreds of historical re-enactment enthusiasts come together to reenact the siege of Fort Erie. <a href="" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Fort_Erie "" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Fort_Erie</a> <a href="" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License "" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...</a>","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Old_Fort_Erie%2C_Fort_Erie%2C_Ontario_%2829871646882%29.jpg/800px-Old_Fort_Erie%2C_Fort_Erie%2C_Ontario_%2829871646882%29.jpg?20220310192001","[{""name"":""Mindmatrix"",""url"":""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Mindmatrix""}]","Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic","water buffalo","jpeg","https://commons.wikimedia.org/","2022-03-10","4,000 × 3,000 "

The church saw the addition of a matching addition in 1936, also designed by Fuchino, which housed a parish hall and classrooms.  Built of redwood with a steel frame, the five-story church building features an irimoya roof with flared corners, a 90-foot-tall tower, a rustic stone base, layered gabled and hipped roofs, exposed rafter ends, casement and awning windows, clapboard siding, decorative trim at the gable ends, a munekado (gate with side gable roof) at the entrance to the church grounds from Elm Street, a massive fourteen-foot-tall pair of wooden doors, a balcony on the exterior facade of the 1936 addition and a secondary entrance featuring a pair of french doors and a karahafu gable at the Pensacola Street facade, and a corrugated metal roof.  Inside, the building features acid stained concrete floors, a 30-foot-tall vestibule between the sanctuary and 1936 Parish Hall wing that runs the width of the building, columns with elbow brackets, and decorative ceiling panels painted by artist Yunosuke Ogura.  In 1960, a modernist Educational wing was added to the building, which was laid out to include a courtyard between it and the original structure, and an additional munekado gate integrated into the building at the Pensacola Street facade.  The Educational wing features a simplified form of the original Japanese-inspired design of the church with a gabled and hipped roof, large banks of windows, concrete exteiror, and corrugated metal roofing.  The building is one of the most distinctive church structures in the Hawaiian islands, and is one of the best examples of Japanese-style architecture in the United States.","https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52264011453_e9ba197d6a_o.jpg","[{""name"":""Warren LeMay"",""url"":null}]","by-sa","classroom","jpeg","https://www.flickr.com/","2022-05-07","3959x2969"

The Operations Building was completed by 1941, but the Ford Island Control Tower was still under construction at the time of the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor by Japanese forces, only standing at about 80% complete.  The building was strafed by attacking aircraft during the attack, but was left mostly undamaged.  Elsewhere on Ford Island, massive damage was done to hangers, moored ships, and other military assets by the surprise attack, leading to the deaths of 2,403 people.  The building originally housed a garage for service vehicles, administrative offices and operations offices, a small number of barracks, an aerological monitoring tower, a large water tank, and an aircraft control tower.  The operations building was built of concrete and features broad concrete canopies, steel awning and pivot windows, a semi-circular bay window on the front, two garage bays at one end of the first floor, an aerological tower on the roof, and streamline moderne styling.  The rear wing of the operations building is a utilitarian, unadorned structure with smaller windows and no canopies, with the 156-foot-tall cylindrical steel tube-shaped Ford Island Control Tower, which served as an aircraft control tower and water tank, with multiple balconies at multiple levels on the exterior of the tower, and a control room at the top surrounded by window walls, allowing for sweeping views of the airfield.  Originally painted in camouflage three-tone gray, the tower was later repainted in the iconic orange and white color scheme it is now known for in the early 1960s.  The Naval Air Station Ford Island buildings and air strip were listed as a National Historic Landmark in 1964, owing to their significance during World War II and the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.  With the closure of the airfield by the United States Navy in 1966, the airfield became a civilian general aviation training airport in the 1970s.  The building served as a fire station for Ford Island, a chapel for the surrounding Naval base, an air control tower for the civilian landing strip, and a training center for the Naval Station Police Department during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, before falling into disuse, as the civilian general aviation airport was moved to the former air station at Barbers Point, now known as the Kalaeloa Airport.  Following the closure of the airfield and disuse by the naval station, the building languished until the opening of the Pearl Harbor Aviation Museum in the adjacent Hangar 37 in 2006, which led to increased interest in the building’s preservation.  Between 2014 and 2020, the Ford Island Operations Building and Ford Island Control Tower were restored with Historic Preservation Grants from the Historic Hawaii Foundation, and have had their exteriors fully rehabilitated, with work ongoing on building systems and the interiors to allow the control tower and operations building to finally open to the public as part of the Pearl Harbor Aviation Museum in the next few years.","https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52268713955_33248f681a_o.jpg","[{""name"":""Warren LeMay"",""url"":null}]","by-sa","historic landmark","jpeg","https://www.flickr.com/","2022-05-09","3024x4032"

"https://www.flickr.com/photos/warrenlemay/52559645072/","Tower, Buffalo Central Terminal, Paderewski Drive, Broadwa… | Flickr","Built in 1929, this 17-story Art Deco-style former passenger railroad station was designed by Fellheimer &amp; Wagner to replace the multiple previous train stations and termini in Buffalo, which were scattered throughout the city and belonged to different railroads.  The structure stands on the site of the old Union Depot built in 1874, which closed in the early 1920s.  The station began construction in 1925 when the New York Central Railroad settled on building their new union terminal in Buffalo at the site, with the station being built to accommodate the expected growth of Buffalo from a city of about 550,000 people to one with 1.5 million people, and to accommodate continued growth in passenger numbers.  However, both of these projections never materialized, with the city’s population growth and the railroad’s passenger numbers growth, already slowing in the 1920s, slowing further due to the Great Depression during the 1930s, and then beginning a long, steady decline, only being briefly buoyed by World War II before falling out of favor as automobile travel proved more flexible and air travel more swift than train travel.  Due to these circumstances, the terminal was overbuilt and never reached its full capacity during its operations, only coming close during World War II due to resource shortages and mass mobilization of the United States during wartime.  The terminal was offered for sale by the New York Central Railroad for one million dollars in 1956, but found no buyers, with continuing declines in passenger numbers, coupled with the decline in the population of Buffalo itself, leading to several services being ended during the 1950s and 1960s.  In 1966, the railroad, in an effort to save costs and downsize their facilities, demolished several outbuildings in the complex, and in 1968, the once powerful New York Central Railroad, a husk of its former self, merged with the Pennsylvania Railroad in an attempt to consolidate their expenses and save both companies, but this merger proved unsuccessful, leading to their bankruptcy in 1976, with both railroads absorbed into the public-private partnership known as Conrail.

In the meantime, Amtrak was formed in 1971 to provide passenger rail service in the United States, operating out of the terminal until 1979, with the agency facing budgetary limitations that did not allow them to renovate the aging structure, which, when coupled with the massive expenses of keeping the building comfortable, dry, and well-lit, led to the agency building two smaller stations in Buffalo during the 1970s to replace it.  The terminal was subsequently purchased by Anthony T. Fedele, whom managed to maintain the building in decent condition, but was unable to find any interested developers to reuse the building, and eventually fell behind on taxes, leading to the building being seized at foreclosure so the taxes could be recouped by the government.  During the time it was owned by Fedele, the building was vacated by Conrail’s offices between 1980 and 1984, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, with the final operations at the terminal, the interlocking towers that once signaled trains arriving at the station, being shut down in 1985.  In 1986, the building was purchased at auction by Thomas Telesco, whom did not maintain the building, selling off many artifacts and fixtures from its interior, and proposing grandiose and unrealistic schemes of what he would do with the building, including being a stop on a high-speed rail line between New York and Toronto.  The building was then sold to Bernie Tuchman and Samuel Tuchman, with the building seeing further elements removed and sold, and the building continuing to decay.

In 1997, the terminal, then in poor condition, was purchased by Scott Field of the Preservation Coalition of Erie County, whom paid for the building’s back taxes, and shortly thereafter, formed the Central Terminal Restoration Corporation, transferring ownership of the building to the organization.  The building was stabilized and secured under the stewardship of the Central Terminal Restoration Corporation, which opened the building for public tours in 2003, and holds many fundraising events at the station every year.  The building has been preserved, but a restoration or adaptive reuse of the structure has so far remained elusive.

The building features a brown brick exterior with an octagonal corner tower, with a large barrel-roofed main concourse structure wrapping around the tower to the south and east.  The facade of the tower features multiple setbacks, chamfered corners, corner clock faces at the roofline above the twelfth floor, a rotunda with large archways and buttresses atop the tower with a decorative trim crown at the parapet, vertical window bays that stretch from the building’s base to the roofline, large entrances with metal canopies, large transoms, and stone surrounds, pilasters, and stone trim and caps atop the parapets.  The main concourse portion of the building features large arched curtain walls at the ends of its barrel vaulted roof, a cavernous barrel vaulted interior, large metal canopies over the entrances, and a tunnel underneath that once allowed traffic on Curtiss Street to run beneath the building, though this has been closed since the 1980s due to the building’s decay, with a light court between the waiting room and a low-rise office block in the front, which sits just east of the tower and presents a similar facade treatment to that of the tower, with vertically accentuated window bays and pilasters.  The rear of the building is more spartan in appearance, with a scar from the former location of the entrance to the train concourse to the rear, with the connecting structure having been removed following the discontinuation of railroad services at the building in 1979.  The train concourse features multiple platforms with Art Deco-style aluminum canopies with sleek columns, thin-profile roofs, and rounded ends, with the train concourse featuring arched clerestory windows and a gabled roof, and being in a rather advanced state of deterioration with vegetation having grown throughout the structure and the surrounding abandoned tracks between the platforms.  Attached to the southwest corner of the main building is the baggage building, a simpler six-story Art Deco-style structure with a buff brick exterior, a penthouse above the main entrance to the building, pilasters, vertically accentuated window bays, steel windows, stone spandrel panels, stone trim, and stone parapet caps, with long canopies along the base of the front and rear of the building that protected incoming and outgoing mail and baggage from inclement weather.  To the west of the baggage building is the one-story mail processing building, which features a similar facade treatment, with the main difference besides height being the rooftop monitor windows in the middle of the building’s roof.  Southwest of the baggage and mail processing building, sitting close to Memorial Drive, is a structure that formerly housed the Railway Express Agency, which is more utilitarian than the rest of the surviving complex, and is in an advanced state of decay, with the demolition of the structure being planned to take place sometime this decade.  The structure features large window bays with steel windows, stucco cladding on the brick structure, and the remnants of canopies on the north and south facades of the first floor, with a long and low one-story wing to the rear.

The complex is one of the largest designed by Fellheimer &amp; Wagner, and has maintained a remarkable state of preservation in its original form with few changes since its construction, besides some damage from the years of decay and neglect in the 1980s and 1990s.  Another notable structure by the firm, and one of the most well-known railroad stations in the world, is Grand Central Terminal in New York City, which was also built for the New York Central Railroad.  In addition to Grand Central Terminal, the firm also designed terminals that are more similar in appearance to the Buffalo Central Terminal, including Union Station in South Bend, Indiana, and Cincinnati Union Terminal, with Grand Central Terminal, Buffalo Central Terminal, and Cincinnati Union Terminal being among the largest, most impressive, and most significant railroad stations ever built in the United States.  The station, though unrestored, is still impressive, and hopefully will be eventually adaptively reused for an economically sustainable function.","https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52559645072_c0af6944e1_o.jpg","[{""name"":""Warren LeMay"",""url"":null}]","by-sa","historic building","jpeg","https://www.flickr.com/","2022-07-31","3742x2806"

"https://www.flickr.com/photos/warrenlemay/52908146571/","Merchandise Mart, River North, Chicago, IL | Built in 1928-1… | Flickr","Built in 1928-1930, this Art Deco-style building was designed by Graham, Anderson, Probst and White for Marshall Field and Company, and is known as Merchandise Mart, housing multiple retail and wholesale operations on the former site of a train yard, with the massive structure occupying an entire city block.  The building consists of a bulky and boxy eighteen-story block, with a tower in the center of the facade facing the Chicago River extending beyond the primary roofline of the building an additional seven stories, making the building 25 stories and 340 feet (103 meters) tall.  The building consolidated thirteen wholesale warehouses, and was the largest building in the world by floor area when it opened in 1930, holding the distinction until the completion of the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia in 1943.  The building was built with a concrete and steel structure, being built utilizing methods and materials previously reserved for larger infrastructure projects like hydroelectric dams.  The building was purchased in the mid-1940s by the Kennedy family of Boston, whom owned it for over half a century, and utilized the proceeds from their ownership of the building to build their wealth and fund their political ambitions.  In 1998, the building was sold by the Kennedy family to the Vornado Realty Trust.

The building features multiple octagonal towers, with a large tower in the center of the facade facing the Chicago River that features the tallest portion of the building, and smaller towers at the corners of the building and ends of the rooftop penthouse, which are topped with octagonal copper hipped roofs, and feature setbacks as they rise, increasing in frequency towards the top of the towers.  The building’s facade is relatively vertical up to the fifteenth floor, with setbacks of the facade of the main block at the sixteenth and eighteenth floors, and similar setbacks of the corner towers, as well as the nineteenth floor of each tower.  The building’s limestone facade is broken up by vertical window bays with one-over-one windows, with copper spandrel panels between windows on the fourth through fourteenth floors and sixteenth and seventeenth floors, as well as decorative pilasters, belt coursing, and sculptures.  The base of the building’s facade features tall storefronts that have spandrel panels and are separated by fluted pilasters, and are as wide as two window bays on the upper floors.  The window bays at the top of the building feature chamfered corners, with the building being crowned with decorative trim atop the parapets that enclose the large low-slope roof of the building, and trim around the base of the copper hipped roof on the towers.  The building’s main entrance, at the base of the largest tower and facing the Chicago River, is recessed at the rear of a portico, and features a tall curtain wall above three revolving doors, with two lower alcoves to either side.  The building’s main tower once featured 56 terra cotta busts depicting Native American chiefs, commemorating the site’s early heritage as a trading center, which were removed in a renovation in 1961.  Inside, the building features approximately 7 miles of corridors, with a lobby featuring a high ceiling, fluted rectilinear marble columns, a terrazzo floor, decorative murals around the base of the ceiling, marble cladding on the walls with granite base, bronze Art Deco-style elevator doors, large showrooms for furniture and interior design firms, office space, and multiple restaurants.  The building’s major common areas generally maintain their original character, with the showrooms having been modernized and adapted to different tenant needs over time.

The building has continued to adapt to new tenants over time, with a modern annex building known as 350 North Orleans, or the Chicago Apparel Center, being built on the block to the west in 1977, designed by the notable firm of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, which is connected to the original building by an enclosed walkway over the street built in 1988 and designed by Helmut Jahn.  The building underwent a major renovation in the 1980s that updated and modernized various building systems, and between 1989 and 1991, saw the restoration and rehabilitation of the facade and major interior common areas under the direction of the firm Beyer Blinder Belle.  The building also has its own transit stop of the Chicago Transit Authority L, presently served by the Brown and Purple lines, one of only two commercial properties to have their own stop on the rapid transit system, with the building having housed the main offices of the Chicago Transit Authority from 1947 until 2004.  The management of the building in recent decades has implemented many green energy and sustainable practices into the operations of the building, achieving the LEED existing buildings Silver certification in 2007.  The building continues to house retail, wholesale, and office space, today still being one of the largest buildings in central Chicago.","https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52908146571_5a1176e9c0_o.jpg","[{""name"":""Warren LeMay"",""url"":null}]","by-sa","street art mural","jpeg","https://www.flickr.com/","2022-11-07","2885x3847"

Paintpots, or mudpots, are hot pools of thin to thick muddy material consisting of clay-sized grains of clay minerals mixed with varying amounts of water. Rising gases result in bursting bubbles of mud at the surface. The clay forms by chemical weathering of rhyolite lava, a common lithology in the Yellowstone Hotspot area. When rising hydrogen sulfide gas (H2S), exsolved from subsurface magma, reaches the top of the water table, oxidation occurs and sulfuric acid forms (H2SO4). The sulfuric acid reacts with the rhyolite, forming various clay minerals. Mudpots in Yellowstone tend to have thin mud in boreal spring and early summer and boiling-type bubbles appear at the surface. In boreal late summer and autumn, the mud is thick, which alters the bubble surfacing and bubble bursting behavior of rising gases. Fountain Paintpots has various delicate shades of pinks, grays, yellows, and orangish-browns. The non-gray colors are from a variety of disseminated iron oxide species.

The container’s bill, tho’ as weighty [p. 2] as any on this side of the water, promises everything I could wish The bonnet must be just what I shall desire for the Spring & your remembrance of everything, even to the hoops, was very kind. I have just got Julia Gardner’s wedding card, so there will, no doubt, be some fine ball beofe long at which the Rose des Alpes can bloom Harriot has her usual Xmas party with the children as foam on the champagne of the latter part of the evening. Last night I was at a pleasant tea-party at the Norton’s for Mrs Field, who prolongs her stay in Cambridge by a visit to Mrs Cary, who is established in her new house. Emily Otis Eliot was there, looking very pretty, & told me of her sister’s [p. 3] wedding. Talking of weddings Stillman’s was the oddest – He returned on a Tuesday, renewed his engagement, which had been broken off, & the next day was married, while a tea party was going on the house, only a portion of the guests being invited in to the ceremony! Then the happy & hurried pair set off at once for Europe. Field has brought home an album of photographs, the small size, of distinguished people which interest us very much, & Henry would like to have you get him some of the literary celebrities (he does not care for statesmen) & artists, musical & other, of chiefest note. The Convention has met at Charleston, but we do not yet hear of secession as a ‘fait accompli” – [p. 4] There seems rather, the last few days, less zeal for it everywhere, & the great fear is now of unworthy compromises being extorted from the North, - far worse than losing those few troublesome states. I trust, however, the Republicans will stand firm, after such encouragement from the people to do so, - & such a struggle & victory. The decided expression of non-sympathy with the South from England & France has somewhat sobered the mad traitors apparently. “Vanity Fair” has a capital caricature of Buchanans vacillating policy, Dogberry's (B) charge to Seacoal (Lincoln) in making him captain of the watch – ‘to arrest all “vagrom men” – “But if they will not stand –“ “Then let them go, in God's name” The Fields are so sorry to be here just as you are away. I like her as much as I do him & think them alike. Papa is so [p. 1 cross] much better I hope you won’t think of a winter passage. Henry has bought the Nahant cottage, conjointly with you, for $5,000. This was as cheap as he could get it, as some one else wanted it. So that is secure & will always be of value. I hope you will much enjoy your winter Give my love to Mrs Brooks & Emmeline if still in Paris. Henry has a poem in the Jan Atlantic- ""Paul Revere's Ride"" – Poor Alice comes in frozen in her skates.

"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Counting_board_with_calculi.jpg","Counting board with calculi.jpg","English: The exact form and use of ancient Greek, Roman, Egyptian, and other ancient counting boards (abacuses) is unknown. Few physical artifacts remain, because most counting boards were made of perishable materials such as wood, cloth, leather, or even some lines scratched in the dirt, and used common items as tokens such as pebbles, coins, or shells. No extant sources describe how to operate an ancient counting board. This image shows a hypothetical ancient counting board made of black lines drawn on a wooden board, with pebbles (Latin calculi ) used as counters. This version follows a common convention from Medieval European counting boards whereby powers of ten (1, 10, 100, 1000) were indicated by lines, with counters placed on the line representing that power of ten, while counters placed in the space between lines represented five times the adjacent power of ten (i.e. 5, 50, 500, 5000). Here each line and space is labeled with the associated Roman numeral, M = 1000, D = 500, C = 100, L = 50, X = 10, V = 5, I = 1, but historical counting boards might have used unlabeled lines. The specific number shown, 2648, can be broken into 2 × 1000 + 1 × 500 + 1 × 100 + 4 × 10 + 1 × 5 + 3 × 1, each of which can be represented with a pebble. In Roman numerals, this number is written MMDCXXXXVIII.","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Counting_board_with_calculi.jpg/545px-Counting_board_with_calculi.jpg?20240528184842","[{""name"":""Jacobolus"",""url"":""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Jacobolus""}]","Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International","ancient artifacts","jpeg","https://commons.wikimedia.org/","2024-05-28","2,130 × 2,342 "

The building predated the buildings around it, with early photos showing it standing alone along Lincoln Avenue prior to the construction of the adjacent Wilson Apartments and Jeanel Building. Built to house the Krause Music Store, the building was constructed to be the residence and music store of William P. Krause, whom lived in the building and operated the store until 1929, with Krause occupying the upstairs apartment until he passed by his own hand inside the apartment in 1931 due to his finances and business being ruined by the Great Depression. The building then was rented and eventually sold by his widow, serving as a funeral home from the 1930s until 1990, seeing the first floor facade altered and the terra cotta facade acid washed. In 1990, the building was purchased by Scott Elliott, whom restored the facade and operated a business known as Klemscott Galleries in the first floor, with the space being occupied around the turn of the millennium by a gift shop known as The Museum of Decorative Arts. In 2006, the building was purchased by Pooja and Peter Vukosavich of Studio V Design, who moved their offices into the building after an award-wining restoration of the facade and rehabilitation of the interior. The building features a front facade clad in terra cotta panels, with sullivanesque details, including a large central band of ornamentation with a wreath-like sculptural element at the parapet, with a tree trunk-like element below that runs to a large ornament at the center of the facade above the recessed section of the first floor, which features a large crown of leaves around a central geometric shape, and a smaller branching element above the second story-windows. The facade also features leaded glass casement windows, decorative trim around the windows, a recessed retail shopfront with two Craftsman-style doors, a row of lightbulbs on the wall and ceiling of the recessed section of the facade, a tile floor at the recessed entryway and storefront window, and decorative panels with alternating geometric and botanical motifs. The interior of the building features a first floor retail space which has been configured as offices, with an apartment for William P. Krause and his wife on the second floor, with the interior of the building and all other elements except for the facade being the work of William Presto. The interior has been stripped of some of its original detail after decades of various owners and uses, but does maintain much of its original plaster, woodwork, and doors. The rear of the building was heavily renovated and modified during the 2006 renovation and restoration, seeing the rear wall on the first floor opened up with a large glass storefront to a landscaped courtyard behind the building, and a contemporary metal stair being added to allow easier access to the second floor. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006, and was designated as a Chicago Landmark in 1977.","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Krause_Music_Store_Building%2C_Lincoln_Avenue%2C_Lincoln_Square%2C_Chicago%2C_IL_-_54042428477.jpg/449px-Krause_Music_Store_Building%2C_Lincoln_Avenue%2C_Lincoln_Square%2C_Chicago%2C_IL_-_54042428477.jpg?20241010180041","[{""name"":""Ser Amantio di Nicolao"",""url"":""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Ser_Amantio_di_Nicolao""}]","Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic","souvenir shop","jpeg","https://commons.wikimedia.org/","2024-10-10","2,795 × 3,727 "
